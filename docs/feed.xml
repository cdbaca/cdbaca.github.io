    <p>Real knowldge arises through confrontations with real things. Work, then, offers a broadly available premonition of philosophy. Its value, however, does not lie solely in pointing to some more rarefied experience. Rather, in the best cases, work may itself approach the good sough in philosophy, understood as a way of life: a community of those who desire to know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a> says in <em>Steal Like an Artist</em> that you ought to keep a swipe file for anything you find interesting, useful, etc. I'm not very good at that. Usually I have like 20 tabs open, then I forget about them till later and then have to clean them up or forget why I was interested in the first place.</p>

<p>Maybe a blog is a good place to keep a swipe file? Let's see. Maybe eventually I'll just have a dedicated page/section to this stuff if it gets big enough.</p>

            <title>Social Web</title>
            <pubDate>2023-07-21 09:48:01</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/social-web.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/social-web.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Had a thought this morning that I wanted to jot down.</p>

<p>Truly being social -- like, out in the real world, i.e., making plans, spending time with people who share and do not share our interests, etc. -- <em>requires</em> friction. Being social is at least some amount of work. It should be easy in some ways, but the act of getting together, of managing schedules, of putting time aside, of having conversations, of being awkward... those are all kind of icky sometimes.</p>

<p>The social web that we've known has essentially tried to reduce all that friction down to zero. Algorithms make decisions for you -- what you see, whose thoughts you see, when you see it. Notifications take away the friction of thinking about the folks you want to talk to and have relationships with. Like buttons take away the requirement of figuring out where our friends stand on things and what they might think about us.</p>

<p>As I was surfing throough some blogs the other day, I realized that there was lot more friction there. You get caught in loops, hit dead ends, you rely on who other people know and what they've come across. There are no machines <em>guiding</em> your path. The path is created by following what catches your eye.</p>

<p>Maybe a better social web is frictiony. Maybe more friction, not less, is what we need to recover some of what we've lost.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In 2004, most people weren’t viewing the internet through a bunch of social networks and algorithmic feeds. Facebook and Twitter were barely blips on the radar. At that point, most people experienced the internet by typing in URLs and going to websites. A few tools like NetNewsWire and Bloglines had cropped up to make it easier to subscribe to lots of sites in one place, but these RSS readers were mostly tools for nerds. Most users were stuck managing bookmarks and browser windows and furiously refreshing their favorite sites just to see what was new. Wetherell’s prototype wasn’t complicated like NetNewsWire, it didn’t crash like Bloglines, and the Javascript interface felt fast and smooth. It immediately felt like a better way to keep up with the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social">"Who Killed Google Reader?"</a></p>

<p>Makes me want to build an RSS reader. Also makes me wonder if the internet could have been just a little bit different had Google thrown what they had at this thing. Maybe that's naive or idealistic, but a social network built around following real things, perhaps built a bit more organically, sounds pretty pleasant given all the current shit out there.</p>
