A general fitness update:

I've been working out consistently 8/22/22, which is right at 13 weeks. The first few weeks, I was using the [r/Fitness Basic Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/). This was helpful just for getting into weightlifting again (I haven't lifted weights since high school!). It helped lower the barrier and increase my confidence since I was just relearning a few basic barbell moves.

After a few weeks, my confidence was high enough that I was able to switch over to a routine that I felt better suited my needs. r/Fitness doesn't recommend it, but I decided to go with [StrongLifts 5x5](stronglifts.com), since it seemed like a logical step up. Roughly the same basic barbell lifts:

### A Day
1. Squat
2. Bench Press
3. Barbell Rows

### B Day
1. Squat
2. Overhead Press
3. Deadlift

You can go to his site for more details. But the basic idea is, start with really low weight on all lifts (the bar if you can, or a little bit of weight if it needs to be off the floor). Every move is 5 sets of 5 reps with the same weight. The next time you do that move, you increase the weight by 5lbs (2.5 weights on each side). Pure linear progression until your form breaks down or you can't lift the weight. Within a few weeks, I felt good enough to also add in extra arm work (A day: dips and skullcrushers, B day: chin ups and barbell or dumbbell curls). 

### Postives / Wins
- My chin ups have increased drastically. Before I started lifting, I could only do 1-2 chin ups. I can now do roughly 3 sets of 5 or 6 with no assistance, and that's after I do heavy lifting.
- Deadlift is currently sitting at around 165 lbs.
- I'm seeing body changes which are really cool. I haven't seen real upper body tone on me in a loooooooong time. It's nice to feel like I have muscles and to feel strong.

### Negatives / Struggles
- Currently dealing with ann anterior hip flexor issue. It seems like it might have been caused by bad squat form. I've fixed that (I think), but it's gonna take a while to heal, so I'm sticking around the 115-130 range for my squats.
- Overhead press has been stalled for weeks now. I made it to about 65-70 lbs but just can't get 5x5. 

I can see why r/Fitness overall doesn't recommened StrongLifts. Honestly, I think it's a great program for someone starting out. It's simple, effective for building quick strength, and it's a quick workout (mine are usually 45-55 minutes). But I think the deload program doesn't really work. This is obvious by the OHP struggles I'm having. I also think it's possible that for many people who lack strength, growing your squat weight that quickly and squatting so often has the potential for injuring you if you aren't careful or don't listen to your body.

At the end of the day, my goal is really to support other activities I want to do (mainly, running and climbing). I'll continue doing StrongLifts for at least another 2 weeks to finish out 12 full weeks on the program, but I may end up switching to [Jim Wendler's 5/3/1](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/) or the [GZCL program](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/). My only concern with those are the time commitment. I just don't have more than an hour or so in the mornings, and that's when I'm working out. But either way, I'm trying to play the long game here. I want to be strong and healthy, not necessarily make my life revolve around being "a weightlifter."
