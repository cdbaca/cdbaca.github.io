### Currently listening: *Midnight Marauders* - A Tribe Called Quest

I gotta say, it's weird to listen to a group's discography, and for each album to be incredible, *and* for each album to be better than the last. Also fun to listen to these as I read the corresponding chapters in *Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest*.
