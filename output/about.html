<h1>I'm Chris Baca</h1>
<br>
<h2>I used to want to be a writer.</h2>

<h2>I used to want to be a pastor.</h2>

<h2>I used to want to be a professor.</h2>

<h2>I used to want so many things.</h2>
<br>
<p>Maybe someday I'll be some or all of those things. I doubt it, but maybe. What's more important to me now
    is becoming the kind of person I am supposed to be. And that has nothing to do with the things I achieve or
    accomplish.
    <br><br>
    My goal with this site is to have a hub for myself to think and grow and learn. Aside from being a good dad and
    husband first, that's the core of who I want to be: someone who learns, someone who is curious, someone who is filled
    with wonder about the world and the people around me.
    <br><br>
    So this site is going to be filled (hopefully) with lots of weird, mundane, disconnected things. I'll go off on
    bunny trails. I'll explore something obsessively for a while and then abandon it when I am satisfied. This is really
    for no one else but myself. If others like it, that's fine. But I spent so much of my time before making things with
    a thought about what others would think -- worried that I was too heretical, too boring, too traditional or progressive.
    Maybe I am all or none of those things. But this site is just a poor digital reflection of me. Nothing more.
