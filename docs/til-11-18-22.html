    <p>I came across an issue today with the generator I've written. If I write multiple posts in a day, the RSS feed may not pick up the newest post, because all the original post dates were set to today's date, but a time of 00:00:00 CST. So if it doesn't sort it properly, a feed reader may not pick up the newest post of the day because it could get pushed to the bottom of the list of today's posts instead of the top.</p>

<p>To fix that, I introduced datetimes to my "create a post" script, and then had to manipulate that datetime string to do what I needed in the creation of the data structures for the site. E.g., I wanted only the date (not the time) to show up on the index page, but I want them in order of writing in reverse. I also wanted the feed to be in reverse order of writing so that even if I post multiple times a day, feed readers will pick up the newest post.</p>

<p>The problem is, I have multiple functions doing the work of creating posts, manipulating data, creating the index page vs. the RSS feed vs. actual posts. But there is a single reference list of dictionaries I'm passing into these functions. In the script, my "make<em>index" function happens upstream of the "make</em>rss" function. And even though the index function was getting the right order, somehow, after I was passing in and manipulating the data in the function, the <em>original list</em> was getting manipulated even though I assigned it to a new variable.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a feature/bug in Python (I'm sure someone <em>likes</em> that this happens in Python... I didn't experience that particular joy today). For example, if I have a list of lists called "posts" and then say posts<em>copy = posts, if I manipulate values within the posts</em>copy list, any values I change there <em>will also change</em> the values in the reference list. That's bonkers, but whatever. After a couple of hours of cursing the void, I found my answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68712435/changes-made-in-python-list-showing-up-in-copy-of-original-list">here</a>. Not only do you need to assign the values to a new variable, you have to make a "deepcopy" of the original list and assign it (if the list in question has other data structures inside it). So instead of</p>

<p>`</p>

<pre><code>posts_copy = copy
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>I needed to do:</p>

<p>`</p>

<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy

posts_copy = deepcopy(posts)
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>From there, I was able to manipulate values in the function without worrying about overwriting data in the original list.</p>

<p>I like programming, but that was maddening.</p>
