Due to my insistence on avoiding social media (except for you Reddit, which, as a side note, I continue to return to like cigarette addict to his vape pen), I've been largely shielded from *~the discourse~*.

Instead, I have chosen to focus on other things. In the physical world, that's been my work, my family, my home, my health. Those things have proven far worthier of my attention than whatever bullshit is in the waterfalls of opinion online.

Digitally too, though. RSS and podcasts are the majority of my digital diet (and even then, not much on the podcast side). I listened to Ezra Klein talk on someone else's podcast about the debate last night, which is the extent of what I'll listen to on this topic. I have an opinion (or several) on the election and the candidates and what should happen.

But, you know, at the end of the day, even digitally I have other more important things to focus on. I like my blog and I want to maintain it. I am currently in the middle of part I of Nand2Tetris (This week is part 4 -- the Hack computer language. The last three weeks I've spent building logic gates, an ALU, and RAM... digitally of course), and I am actually really enjoying learning computer science from first principles onward. I think I'll have another post forthcoming on this, but I have been thinking a lot about what computers are, what digital information is, and because of those things, what we **should** use computers for. They are good for some things and not others, and that ultimately comes down to what we want to be and focus on as human beings.

Rabbit trailing a little bit. Suffice it to say, I think this week has shown me that digitally I have taken the right steps, and I want to keep moving in that direction.
