Surfing the web... not something any of us normies have done in a long time in our spare time. It used to be like that. Not so much anymore. We've all been corraled to somewhere between 5-10 websites so our attention can get farmed for cash from advertisers. Your regular reminder that this internet world sucks a big butthole, and there is a better way.

I've spent the last week falling down a rabbit hole, which has been, honestly, an *amazing* feeling. I'm just gonna link a bunch of the stuff I've found, because it's cool and I don't want to forget what I've found. But there's a ton to discover and a ton to learn from that isn't just f*cking algorithms force feeding me whatever it thinks I want to see or read or hear.

What I'm gathering:

- There are deeper things going on on the web than I realized. I had just lost sight of that.
- Vanilla HTML/CSS are still dope, and you can make really cool things with them.
- The open web is ripe for normal people to pick up. There are ways of interacting online that are so different than what so many of us have been taught.
