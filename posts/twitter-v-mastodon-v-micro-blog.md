>> Twitter right now is mainly about Twitter but also a little about Mastodon. And Mastodon is mainly about Mastodon but also a lot about Twitter. Both places seem to be pretty chaotic, but here at micro.blog @manton & co. are keeping things smooth and steady. It helps that there donâ€™t seem to be many drama-addicted folks around here.

Yeah, agreed. I hadn't been on Twitter in while, but jumped to Mastodon just to check things out and see if it could operate differently than Twitter. My observations:

1. *Mastodon is better than Twitter in many ways.* Built in RSS feeds for accounts, ActivityPub compatible so it's genuinely federated, no quote tweeting, better moderation (similar to the better Reddit communities).
2. *Mastodon doesn't quite live up to what I want it to be.* What I wanted was, perhaps, a way for people to be self-hosted but have a local space where that stuff got sent and you could just check in and see what others are thinking or up to.
3. *Lots of people at Mastodon are just talking about Twitter.* I actually had to filter out posts that mention the word, but then there are people that call it the "bird site" or talk about Elon or whatever. I want Mastodon to be more than that but maybe that will take some time.

I'm also not convinced Mastodon won't become a sort of Twitter 2.0. Maybe not quite as hateful or outrageous, but still chaotic. I've been considering trying micro.blog instead to see if that would function closer to what I want out of the web. It seesm like it's possible that service is closer than Mastodon.
