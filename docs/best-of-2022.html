    <h1 class="post-title">Best of 2022</h1>
    <p>I usually try to wait until very close to the end of the year before I make a "best of" post. I do this because it's quite often that I come across something really good in December (this is my only real issue with Spotify's Wrapped, which I love: it happens at the beginning of December, so it misses a whole month of listening). Anyway, here are my favorite things I watched/listened to/read/did this year. None of the lists are in any particular order</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Hell on Church Street</em> - Punch Brothers</li>
<li><em>Illmatic</em> - Nas</li>
<li><em>People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li><em>The Low End Theory</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li><em>Midnight Marauders</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li>"Earfquake" - Tyler, the Creator</li>
<li><em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em> - Kendrick Lamar</li>
<li>"Lavender Haze" - Taylor Swift (a nice little nod to <em>Mad Men</em> here in the title)</li>
<li><em>All The Truth That I Can Tell</em> - Dashboard Confessional</li>
<li><em>The Score</em> - The Fugees</li>
<li>"Cath.." - Death Cab for Cutie</li>
<li>"Electric Feel" - MGMT</li>
<li>"GET A LIL BAG" - Tobe Nwigwe</li>
<li>Three main genres I got really into this year: 90s/early 00s alt rock, 2000s indie, and 90s hip hop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Movies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Vengeance </li>
<li>The Batman</li>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>

<h2>TV</h2>

<ul>
<li>Severance</li>
<li>The Bear</li>
<li>White Lotus</li>
<li>Stranger Things</li>
<li>Dave</li>
<li>Better Call Saul Season 5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Books</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> - Frank Herbert</li>
<li><em>Dune Messiah</em> - Frank Herbert</li>
<li>The first three books in <em>The Expanse</em> - James S.A. Corey</li>
<li><em>Go ahead in the Rain</em> - Hanif Abdurraqib</li>
<li><em>Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</em> - Lindsay C. Gibson</li>
<li>As always, I'm reading to the kids every night. Currently about to finish <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> with Lyla.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ezra Klein's interview with Maryanne Wolf</li>
<li>Dissect's season on <em>Inside</em> by Bo Burnham</li>
<li>Serial's season on <em>The Trojan Horse Affair</em>. Felt a little whodunnit-ish, and was a fun listen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Inside</em> on Switch</li>
<li><em>Axiom Verge</em> on Switch</li>
<li>I've been weightlifting three days a week since August. Started with StrongLifts and recently switched to GZCLP. I feel stronger, healthier, and better than I have in a long time, even with the running I was doing before. I took a break from running because of some hip issues, but I'm excited to see how running and lifting can complement each other when I get to the new year.</li>
<li>I really took the plunge this year on no social meda / self-hosting and getting into indie-web spaces. I'm still trying to figure out what this can look like for me. I really hate being on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I think TikTok is a really awful service that hijacks our brains. I love RSS, the idea of federation, the ideal of an open web.</li>
<li>We visited Schlitterbahn a couple of times. On one of those visits, Paisley and I got to go and hang, just the two of us. That was a blast.</li>
<li>Went to see Mae perform <em>The Everglow</em> in February, and saw Dashboard Confessional in August. Both shows were amazing.</li>
<li><em>We got a dog.</em> Really.</li>
<li>We finally removed all the carpet from our whole house. Long overdue.</li>
<li>I got a pretty bomb ass tattoo. Not quite a half sleeve, but it covers most of my upper right arm. Very pleased, and it's beautiful.</li>
<li>We got to spend a week in South Padre with Elaine's brother and his family. I love the beach more than most things. Also, boogie boarding, good drinks, good food, and a large amount of relaxation.</li>
<li>I'll forever look at 2022 as the year that Elaine (re)discovered her obsession with scratch-off tickets.</li>
<li>My best friend since high school moved to TX in the summer. We have gotten to reconnect a ton, and that's been really amazing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, there were also some really difficult points in the year. I'm still struggling internally with some family issues. To be honest, I think this will require therapy, and that's been a really hard step for me to take.</p>

<p>On top of that, whatever was left of my faith after leaving Life in Deep Ellum in 2021 feels (at worst) completely gone or (at best) entirely dormant. I have a hard time even remembering what it was <em>like</em> to be a person of faith. Prayer feels largely unnatural. I do not have any kind of feel or sense of "God's presence" as I (think) I used to feel it. Largely, my experience of the world feels unaffected by whether I believe that God exists or not, or whether I am a follower of Jesus or not. I don't want to get too deep into this, as I think it warrants another blog post or set of blog posts. It is sufficient to simply say that my faith is not what it once was, and that's not something I feel I can force. I also don't know if I even <em>want</em> to find a way back to that. Maybe someday. Not right now.</p>

<p>A final note: last week, I accepted a job offer at Green Line Digital as a data analyst to go work on a friend's team there. My final day at SAGU will be January 6th. And while one should never say never, I don't anticipate I'll be coming back this time. Fully remote work, a healthy pay bump, better benefits... it's gonna be a good thing for us overall even if the transition takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thankful for the year, hard parts included.</p>
