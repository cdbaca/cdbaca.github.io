            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I usually try to wait until very close to the end of the year before I make a "best of" post. I do this because it's quite often that I come across something really good in December (this is my only real issue with Spotify's Wrapped, which I love: it happens at the beginning of December, so it misses a whole month of listening). Anyway, here are my favorite things I watched/listened to/read/did this year. None of the lists are in any particular order</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Hell on Church Street</em> - Punch Brothers</li>
<li><em>Illmatic</em> - Nas</li>
<li><em>People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li><em>The Low End Theory</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li><em>Midnight Marauders</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</li>
<li>"Earfquake" - Tyler, the Creator</li>
<li><em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em> - Kendrick Lamar</li>
<li>"Lavender Haze" - Taylor Swift (a nice little nod to <em>Mad Men</em> here in the title)</li>
<li><em>All The Truth That I Can Tell</em> - Dashboard Confessional</li>
<li><em>The Score</em> - The Fugees</li>
<li>"Cath.." - Death Cab for Cutie</li>
<li>"Electric Feel" - MGMT</li>
<li>"GET A LIL BAG" - Tobe Nwigwe</li>
<li>Three main genres I got really into this year: 90s/early 00s alt rock, 2000s indie, and 90s hip hop</li>
</ul>

<h2>Movies</h2>

<ul>
<li>Vengeance </li>
<li>The Batman</li>

<li>The Bear</li>
<li>White Lotus</li>
<li>Stranger Things</li>
<li>Dave</li>
<li>Better Call Saul Season 5</li>
</ul>

<h2>Books</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> - Frank Herbert</li>
<li><em>Dune Messiah</em> - Frank Herbert</li>
<li>The first three books in <em>The Expanse</em> - James S.A. Corey</li>
<li><em>Go ahead in the Rain</em> - Hanif Abdurraqib</li>
<li><em>Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</em> - Lindsay C. Gibson</li>
<li>As always, I'm reading to the kids every night. Currently about to finish <em>Order of the Phoenix</em> with Lyla.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ezra Klein's interview with Maryanne Wolf</li>
<li>Dissect's season on <em>Inside</em> by Bo Burnham</li>
<li>Serial's season on <em>The Trojan Horse Affair</em>. Felt a little whodunnit-ish, and was a fun listen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Everything Else</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Inside</em> on Switch</li>
<li><em>Axiom Verge</em> on Switch</li>
<li>I've been weightlifting three days a week since August. Started with StrongLifts and recently switched to GZCLP. I feel stronger, healthier, and better than I have in a long time, even with the running I was doing before. I took a break from running because of some hip issues, but I'm excited to see how running and lifting can complement each other when I get to the new year.</li>
<li>I really took the plunge this year on no social meda / self-hosting and getting into indie-web spaces. I'm still trying to figure out what this can look like for me. I really hate being on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I think TikTok is a really awful service that hijacks our brains. I love RSS, the idea of federation, the ideal of an open web.</li>
<li>We visited Schlitterbahn a couple of times. On one of those visits, Paisley and I got to go and hang, just the two of us. That was a blast.</li>
<li>Went to see Mae perform <em>The Everglow</em> in February, and saw Dashboard Confessional in August. Both shows were amazing.</li>
<li><em>We got a dog.</em> Really.</li>
<li>We finally removed all the carpet from our whole house. Long overdue.</li>
<li>I got a pretty bomb ass tattoo. Not quite a half sleeve, but it covers most of my upper right arm. Very pleased, and it's beautiful.</li>
<li>We got to spend a week in South Padre with Elaine's brother and his family. I love the beach more than most things. Also, boogie boarding, good drinks, good food, and a large amount of relaxation.</li>
<li>I'll forever look at 2022 as the year that Elaine (re)discovered her obsession with scratch-off tickets.</li>
<li>My best friend since high school moved to TX in the summer. We have gotten to reconnect a ton, and that's been really amazing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, there were also some really difficult points in the year. I'm still struggling internally with some family issues. To be honest, I think this will require therapy, and that's been a really hard step for me to take.</p>

<p>On top of that, whatever was left of my faith after leaving Life in Deep Ellum in 2021 feels (at worst) completely gone or (at best) entirely dormant. I have a hard time even remembering what it was <em>like</em> to be a person of faith. Prayer feels largely unnatural. I do not have any kind of feel or sense of "God's presence" as I (think) I used to feel it. Largely, my experience of the world feels unaffected by whether I believe that God exists or not, or whether I am a follower of Jesus or not. I don't want to get too deep into this, as I think it warrants another blog post or set of blog posts. It is sufficient to simply say that my faith is not what it once was, and that's not something I feel I can force. I also don't know if I even <em>want</em> to find a way back to that. Maybe someday. Not right now.</p>

<p>A final note: last week, I accepted a job offer at Green Line Digital as a data analyst to go work on a friend's team there. My final day at SAGU will be January 6th. And while one should never say never, I don't anticipate I'll be coming back this time. Fully remote work, a healthy pay bump, better benefits... it's gonna be a good thing for us overall even if the transition takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm thankful for the year, hard parts included.</p>

    <p>For the first time, she experienced life in the city as a teenager without an iPhone. She borrowed novels from the library and read them alone in the park. She started admiring graffiti when she rode the subway, then fell in with some teens who taught her how to spray-paint in a freight train yard in Queens. And she began waking up without an alarm clock at 7 a.m., no longer falling asleep to the glow of her phone at midnight. Once, as she later wrote in a text titled the “Luddite Manifesto,” she fantasized about tossing her iPhone into the Gowanus Canal.</p>

            <title>Workout Program Change - GZCLP</title>
            <pubDate>12/16/2022 10:21:52</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/workout-program-change-gzclp.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/workout-program-change-gzclp.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I lasted about 12 weeks on the StrongLifts program. That is, until I got some kind of hip flexor injury. I suspect it was from a massive amount of squatting, along with not-great form for my anatomy. After I took about a week or two off of heavy squatting, the problem resolved itself, but it did make me question whether StrongLifts was a smart program for me. Some people swear by it, but I did find it unbalanced for progress and the focus on one area (squats) above all others.</p>

<p>After doing some more research, I decided to switch over to the GZCLP Program, named for <a href="http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/">Cody LeFever</a>'s Reddit username. It's a linear progression, so you're still <em>basically</em> adding weight each time. But everything is much slower, and takes a more logical approach to progressive overload for the different lifts.</p>

<h3>The basic program is built like a pyramid with tiers:</h3>

<ul>
<li>T1 - Main barbell lift for the day. Heavy, low rep sets to build continuous strength.</li>
<li>T2 - Main assistance for the day, usually an assistance of the <em>previous workout's</em> primary lift. Mid-weight, mid-range rep sets.</li>
<li>T3 - Secondary assistance for the day. 1-3 workouts that are assistance for the T1 and T2 workouts. Low weight, high rep sets.</li>
</ul>

<p>The primary idea here is that the T1 workouts are the "peak" of the pyramid. It's the height of your strength, but it needs support from lower-level bases. T2 helps provide mid-range strength, and T3 provides a solid base to work from. Build out the whole pyramid, and you have a balanced, stable way of maintaining overall strength.</p>

<h3>Two things I'm finding helpful with this program:</h3>

<ol>
<li>On StrongLifts, you are always pushing for 5x5. If you can't get it, you try twice more, then deload and try again. Honestly, that's kinda dumb the more I got into it. I plateaued very quickly on a few lifts, and couldn't get past those humps even after "following the program." On GZCLP, T1 and T2 have a plan for when you fail. For example, on T1 workouts, when you can't hit 5x3, you move to 6x2, then continue the weight progression. When you can't hit that, you move to 10x1. When you fail again, you reduce by 15%, then go back to 5x3. Makes a lot more sense, and there's a sensible method for deloading and continuing growth.</li>
<li>The assistance work is varied, and I think will help with strength gains for the primary lifts. I had no method of doing that before, it was just trying the same lifts again and again, which ignores the possibility that some assitance muscles are too weak for me to grow in the main lifts.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a good overview of the program, see this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/6pjiwd/heres_a_quick_summary_of_the_gzclp_linear/">Reddit post</a>. There's an infographic, and the user also has a free Google Sheet that I'm using to track my workouts for now. I'm gonna give this a go for 12 weeks and see if I can make some better gains in strength. I already feel stronger than I did at the end of StrongLifts.</p>

            <title>Old Philosophy Is Still Good Philosophy</title>
            <pubDate>12/16/2022 08:22:49</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/old-philosophy-is-still-good-philosophy.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In response to a <em>Wired</em> article about preserving our digital selves for an "afterlife," Alan Jacobs writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Notice also — this is universal in such discourse — the unexamined “we”: “2023 will be the year we broaden our definition of what it means to live forever.” Depends on who “we” are, I think. I for one am not interested in broadening my definition of what means to live forever in such a way that it isn’t living and doesn’t last forever.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--<a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/defining-immortality-down/">defining immortality down</a></p>

<p>Connected to this, I'm thinking about the recent spate of excitement around AI and large language models (specifically ChatGPT). Tyler Cowen wrote some about the winners and losers as AI becomes a functional part of how we interact with one another, especially online. One thing he mentions is the idea that perhaps the unreplicable will become more valuable in our society: athletics, gardening, etc.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatively, many humans will run away from such competitive struggles altogether.  Currently the bots are much better at writing than say becoming a master gardener, which also requires skills of physical execution and moving in open space. We might thus see a great blossoming of talent in the area of gardening, and other hard to copy inputs, if only to protect one’s reputation and IP from the bots.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Athletes, in the broad sense of that term, may thus rise in status. Sculpture and dance might gain on writing in cultural import and creativity. Counterintuitively, if you wanted our culture to become more real and visceral in terms of what commands audience attention and inspiration, perhaps the bots are exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The first thing I thought when I read Alan Jacobs's response to that article was this: perhaps the Cartesian "I think, therefore I am" is not so old-fashioned as 21st century philosophy has made it out to be. Cogito ergo sum could, in the day and age of AI and the preservation of our "digital selves," give us a way <em>out</em> of the frenetic online hive-mind thing we have going on right now. Cogito ergo sum allows me to reassert my individualism. I am more than a small bit of data that gets fed into a large language model so it can reproduce generic text about any given subject. I am more than a few terabytes of data at the end of my life so that "I" can be preserved for someone else to interact with.</p>

<p>(And I agree, who really wants to keep a lifelong record of everything we say digitally?? Have we not all watched those <em>Black Mirror</em> episodes?)</p>

<p>It seems to me that perhaps the early-to-late modern philosophers may still have something to say to us. Descartes can still teach us a thing or two about our humanity in the midst of AI.</p>

<p>I gotta say, it's weird to listen to a group's discography, and for each album to be incredible, <em>and</em> for each album to be better than the last. Also fun to listen to these as I read the corresponding chapters in <em>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>.</p>
