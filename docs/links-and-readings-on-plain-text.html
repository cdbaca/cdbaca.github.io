    <p>Via Manuel Morreale's People &amp; Blogs series, I came across some interesting writing, thoughts, and links on focusing on and using plain text for our digital lives. This is interesting to me because I like the thought that plain text is (at minimum) the most durable text format that we have right now (as opposed to .doc or some other file type).</p>

  <p>Everything Buckets are selling you a filesystem, and removing the step of creating and saving a new file within that filesystem. That’s their primary value. Whatever organization scheme they may claim to offer, you can replicate on the filesystem. I promise. Even tags (symlinks, aliases - look ’em up).

  <p>Every few years a new company says you should use their special format. You have to pay them a monthly fee to use it — or keep all of your documents in their care. They offer some convenience or features, but at the cost of flexibility, portability, and independence.</p>

  <p>When you store your writing in one company’s unique format, then you need that program to access it. Then the economy takes a turn, they go out of business, and your work is trapped in an unusable format.</p>

  <p>You will outlive these companies. Your writing should outlive you. Depending on companies is not an option.</p>

  <p>Plain text is un-commercial. It removes you from the world of subscriptions and hype. There will always be plenty of free, non-commercial software in the public domain for reading and editing text files.

<p>My website build is pretty basic, and is essentially built around plain text files (in Markdown) and a couple of templates and Python scripts. But all of it is essentially plain text. At the time, I was building the site to learn about the very basics of personal web framework building (if you could even call it that). But I also stumbled into a world of more digital simplicity, and hopefully by virtue of that, more resilience.</p>
