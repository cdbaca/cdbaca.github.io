    <h3>Music</h3>

<p>It seemed like, for a while, that new music was a little sparse at the beginning of this year. But things seemed to have
picked up pretty well, and I'm hoping that continues for the rest of the year. My favorite albums of the year so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers</em> - Kendrick Lamar</li>
<li><em>Dropout Boogie</em> - The Black Keys</li>
<li><em>Hell on Church Street</em> - Punch Brothers</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than that, my favorite Spotify playlists have been</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1b54zf3bzl5HBjAqWDr6cQ?si=0991b31b087547ea">90s ü§òüèº</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ewpBURWZFY0k9vsAjrKoK?si=912755261bd343e9">eeeeemmmmoooooo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX186v583rmzp?si=67a2213902bf40e3">I Love My '90s Hip-Hop</a> (this one was on
repeat for a long while)</li>
</ul>

<h3>TV &amp; Movies</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Stranger Things</em> - currently watching this, and I gotta say, this season is capturing the magic of the first season.</li>
<li><em>Ozark</em> - we finished this one. Final season, not as good as previous ones, but a relatively satisfying end.</li>
<li><em>Dr. Strange in the Mutiverse of Madness</em> - great on the first watch, not quite as much on the second. Feels like a "setup"
movie. Loved the horror vibes.</li>
<li><em>Moon Knight</em> - Elaine and I could never decide if we liked it or not... but we did keep watching it, so.</li>
<li><em>Dave</em> - I watched the two seasons currently available when I had covid in January. Incredible, funny, touching.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Books &amp; Other Reading</h3>

<p>I'm not reading quite as much as I wanted to this year, but what's new.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Dune</em> - very clear why it's a classic. I also loved <em>Dune Messiah</em>, but <em>Children of Dune</em> hasn't captured
me in the same way.</li>
<li><em>Harry Potter</em> - of course, I've read all of these multiple times, but I'm reading these  out loud to Lyla. We just 
got through <em>Goblet of Fire</em> and it's been really great to relive them with her.</li>
<li>Just got a subscription to Marvel Unlimited, so I'm reading comics some too. Currently reading through Jonathan Hickman's
run with Nick Fury/F4/Avengers/Thanos. I'm enjoying it so far!</li>
</ul>
