I keep ringing the bell a million times over, but I'm such a huge fan of the indie web and blogs in particular. I think it's the best way to resist the pull of large-scale corporations running the internet, and the barrier for entry (despite the technical knowledge sometimes required) is so low, that I think this is the way forward for keeping part of the internet sane.

A series I'm really enjoying from an indie blogger is a weekly series that [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/) is running over at his blog. The series is "People & Blogs" and he's just interviewing other folks on the internet running blogs and who are keeping up their own little corners of the web. The [most recent one](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-eli-mellen) dropped today, and all of them are worth perusing.
