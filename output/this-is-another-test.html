    <h1>This is Another Test</h1>
    <h1>The copycat ssg</h1>

<p>I miss blogging. For the last year, my focus has been learning sql, some data analysis/report writing, 
and Python for work. This has been fun, but I want/need to work on other aspects of my life too.</p>

<p>While I'm familiar with Blogger, Wordpress, and other CMSs that allow you to just "plug and play", I'm not really
interested in the bloat that comes with those systems. So, to combine the programming skills that I've gained,
this project is just a small attempt to do something new/different/quirky. And hopefully respark a love of blogging
and writing again.</p>

<p>Static site generators are pretty basic. The idea is simple:
- Have a directory with markdown files
- Convert those files into HTML, and input that content into a template generator like Jinja
- Put the index, post files, and static files (like CSS) into the output directory
- Serve those files up on a server like Github pages or whatever.</p>

<p>There's a ton out there on SSGs. Here are the different tutorials I'm using for guidance:
- https://www.megacolorboy.com/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator-using-python/
- https://rahmonov.me/posts/static-site-generator/
- https://blog.hamaluik.ca/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator/

<h1>Future Goals:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Generate a page that is instagram/micro.blog-like which allows me to post pictures</li>
</ul>
