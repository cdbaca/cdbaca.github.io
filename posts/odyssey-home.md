I think anyone who listens to synth-y, tech-y, 80s-vibe music on YouTube has come across "Resonance" by Home.

This is such a strange, weird, nostalgia-inducing piece of music. Every time I listen to it, I experience unexplainable feelings of longing and melancholy. It's very strange for a piece of music to do that, but there you have it.

Anyway, I'm still taking a trip in my [Spotify time machine](https://cbaca.blog/spotify-the-time-machine.html) and came across the album [*Odyssey* by Home](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Nz9gdj35Unk1AbfL8Igmx?si=azvxpfevQoumuccsolhM_A), which I discovered after the YouTube algorithm so graciously gifted my with "Resonance." It's pretty great -- many of the songs also have that retro feel and its instrumental nature lends itself to being able to continute to focus at work while I listen.
