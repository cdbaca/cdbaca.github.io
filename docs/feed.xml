            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>The big thing this week has been prepping for my first duck hunt (ðŸ¦†)! I went last year with Zack right after Thanksgiving, but didn't have a license so I was just a bystander. We didn't bag anything last year either, so I'm hoping this is a good little trip for me. I'm SO excited, this is an experience out of my norm. I finished up my hunter's education, got my license, and set up my shotgun/accessories situation.</p>

<p>Halloween was also a fun time! I dressed as Miguel from Coco, and the girls were traditional skeletons from Dia de los Muertos. Lots of folks from the girls' school came over and we ate, passed out candy, and the girls were able to go trick or treating with their friends.</p>

<p>I'm getting reallllll close to the race (I think I'm right at 3 weeks out). My legs are a bit tired and I'm definitely feeling worn down some from training. But overall I think I am ready for the race -- my goal is still to place in the top 3 overall, but I'll be happy with a good race no matter what.</p>

<p>I took the step of deleting internet browser access from my phone, just to mitigate access to stupid feeds and news or whatever. It hasn't fully removed my proclivity for doomscrolling, but it's definitely better than it was, and my mood is anecdotally better as well.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Got the grass mowed last weekend, and that should be the last big mow for the season, thank goodness.</p>

<p>Just wanting to get through this next week mostly -- should be quick as I'm taking Thursday and Friday off, and we're hunting next Monday.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>Just bingeing <a href="https://www.themeateater.com/shows/duck-camp-dinners">Duck Camp Dinners</a>, Jean-Paul Bourgeois is the man, and it's just hyping me up for hunting season.</p>

            <title>Weeknote 5 - 19 to 25 Oct 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-10-25 12:57:17</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>Personally, not much activity happening, which is to say: this was basically a routine sort of week. That's not a bad thing, but I can't think of much that was "of note." </p>

<p>I'm entering the final phase of training, which means I hit another 12 miler last Saturday, and will move into my final two long runs before my taper for the Dino Valley 25K.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-We-Cease-Understand-World/dp/1681375664"><em>When We Cease to Understand the World</em></a> by Benjamin Labatut. I was reading <em>Persepolis Rising</em>, the 7th book in The Expanse saga, but I'm either just not ready for the book or I'm bored with the characters. In theory, a long, sprawling epic story is interesting and consuming. In practice (maybe it's just these authors), this is along time to spend with these characters, and I'm finding the writing style a bit... mediocre?</p>

<p>I did receive some new woodworking tools in this week! I think this completes the "basic collection" that I need to be able to <em>actually</em> start making things. This week's haul included a block plane, a shoulder plane, a coping saw, and some more measuring/marking tools. My first goal is to build <a href="https://www.freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/bookstand">this book stand</a>, and perhaps a dovetail box after that. We'll see where it takes me! I do think project-based work, even if I'm bad at it, is going to be the best way forward here to gain the skills I'm currently lacking.</p>

<p>Work was work-y. Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>P is doing really great. I'm seeing so much growth in her over the last couple of months. I think Elaine and I are both feeling a little reticent to "look at it straight on" in fear of things returning to how they used to be. We had years of tough, and months of REALLY tough. But there are signs from her that things are genuinely looking up and hopeful.</p>

<p>Lyla and I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 last night. We finished the entire book series months and months ago, and have slowly eked our way through the movies.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Same as last week.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I learned today about a music genre called "shoegaze," which seems to be described best by listening to "Mayonaise" by Smashing Pumpkins. I've been looking for a genre that encapsulates the feel of that song for a long time, so this'll be  a fun rabbit hole (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6ujZpAN0v9r?si=2be64f8294614e0b">Spotify playlist to match</a>).</p>

<p>Lots of stuff I'm running into re: avoiding news consumption and online feeds. Wherever this is coming from... I should probably listen. We're less than two weeks out from the election, and the truth is I've been feeling the need to step back from even Reddit/NYT consumption, which are the last vestiges of daily news/daily feeds in my routine. </p>

            <title>Quotes on News Consumption</title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We are not rational enough to be exposed to the
    news-mongering press. It is a very dangerous
    thing, because the probabilistic mapping we get
    from consuming news is entirely different from
    the actual risks that we face. Watching an airplane
    crash on television is going to change your attitude
    toward that risk regardless of its real probability,
    no matter your intellectual sophistication. If you
    think you can compensate for this bias with the
    strength of your own inner contemplation, you are
    wrong. Bankers and economists â€“ who have
    powerful incentives to compensate for newsborne hazards â€“ have shown that they cannot. The
    only solution: cut yourself off from news
    consumption entirely.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--Rolf Dobelli, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf">"Avoid News: Toward a Healthy News Diet"</a></p>

<p>^ Written in 2010; I'd argue in 2024 this is just as applicable to infinite-feed sites. (Reddit being my personal number one culprit that I'm having trouble kicking.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As I've written before, alarming news is nothing new, but the central place the news has come to occupy in many people's psychological worlds is certainly novel. Because of how digital media works â€“ though also because the news developments themselves are legitimately huge â€“ these global dramas start to feel like life's centre of gravity, with the immediate worlds of family, job and neighborhood relegated to the periphery.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--Oliver Burkeman, <a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/r8u8hoh8eeov">"Becoming News-Resilient"</a></p>

<p>One of the things making me think about this right now is just how much I feel like my actual view of reality has been/is being warped by news &amp; media feeds. I know it's election season and these feelings are especially potent for everyone right now. I just want to approach life both calmly and <em>realistically</em>. One may argue that being informed helps with at least the latter, but I find that doubtful.</p>

<p>Lord grant me strength to avoid the bullshit.</p>

            <title>Weeknote 4 - 5 to 18 Oct 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-10-19 12:01:39</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-4-5-to-18-oct-2024.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>Even as I start writing this, I'm realizing how difficult it is to reach back two weeks ago to try to remember what was happening. Here's what I can remember:</p>

<p>The big thing was the end of the cross country season! We made our way to Georgetown last Friday (why I didn't write a weeknote last week), and the junior high and high school teams performed really well. We had a high school girl win her whole division in state, and lots of other runners place and medal in the top 8. Proud of the kids... and also happy the season is over :)</p>

<p>We are in the process of refinancing our mortage -- which we seem to have done at just the right time as rates seem to be rising (??) again. Everything looks like it's going to go through, and we're going to save something like $270 per month on our payment, which is really cool.</p>

<p>I finished a woodworking project! Using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiMjv7lkqI">Rex Krueger's guide to making a Roman-style workbench</a>, I was able to complete this over the course of working on it on and off for the last couple weeks. I made a lot of mistakes, it doesn't exactly look pretty, but it works! Which is a pretty good feeling.</p>

<p>Once I get a couple more work holding options for the bench and a few more tools (said every woodworking hobbyist ever), I think I'll actually be able to make some of the projects that have caught my eye over the last year or so.</p>

<p>Work has been... fine. There is nothing inherently <em>bad</em> about it. I still enjoy my team, LOVE the flexibility, etc. But I'm realizing that I have hit a strange plateau point. There aren't things that I could come across, as of now, that I couldn't just handle with relative ease on my own. That has historically been a challenging time for me in any job I've held, so this is probably going to be a recurring theme until I can figure out how to hit that "sweet spot" at work again.</p>

<p>Training for the Dino Valley 25K is in its most intense training block. I hit 12 miles this morning, and have another few weeks of ramped intensity before I can back down into a taper. My legs are feeling it, but I'm feeling pretty good about my chances of placing top 3 overall. But we will see! Goal A is top 3, goal B is sub 2:04, goal C is finish with a smile on my face.</p>

<p>Elaine and I have had the chance to take every Wednesday to spend time together. Every other Wednesday is our "pastorate" (All Saints Dallas's version of small groups), and on the off weeks we are taking a date night. It has been wonderful.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Currently working on the color run at the girls' school. My job is to create the course, procure cones, and just think about the logistics of the run itself.</li>
<li>I <em>think</em> there is still time to plant the fall garden (seems like it may be a warmer-than-average winter), so we should probably get on that this weekend.</li>
<li>I really need to mow, but... lol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new Bon Iver EP: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Cwxsws0uZcu61gliYLOEm?si=-dtr6l14Q2mAS3u3HO4scQ">SABLE,</a></li>
<li>Watching The Penguin. Maybe not <em>excellent</em> but it is fun.</li>
<li>Finished <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/introduction/"><em>Moonbound</em></a> by Robin Sloan, recommended.</li>
<li>This PBS show, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/woodwrights-shop-roman-work-bench/"><em>The Woodwright's Shop</em></a> &lt;-- This is a link to a specific episode where Chris Shwarz is demonstrating how to use a Roman workbench, but other episodes are fun too. Boy do I love public television sometimes.</li>
<li>There is a new coffee shop in our little town that is <em>excellent</em>: <a href="https://bloomandpour.com/">Bloom &amp; Pour</a>. We know one of the owners, and I'm so happy Waxahachie has a space like this, finally.</li>

            <title>Weeknote 3 - 28 Sept to 4 Oct 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-10-04 13:59:46</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-3-28-sept-to-4-oct-2024.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>This is the second to last week of cross country. While I love cross country so much, I'm also ready to be done with early wake up calls and long Saturdays. Now onto the end of my race training!</p>

<p>In trying to decide on a woodworking bench design, I remembered that I had already bought the material a while back for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiMjv7lkqI">Rex Krueger's low Roman-style bench</a>. While it's basic and will not meet all the needs I'll have for woodworking, it's:</p>

<p>a) a start, which is what I really need and,
b) "free" since the materials have already been bought</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this in spare little free moments I have -- 20 minutes here, 30 minutes there. I figure it's the only real way I'll be able to actually pursue a hobby that's a craft and not just wasting my time. Once the bench is built I'm hoping to learn to cut some more precise joints, and maybe make a few of the projects from <a href="https://www.freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/">Matt Estlea's free woodworking school</a>.</p>

<p>I took Wednesday off and we all went to the Texas State Fair. Besides the heat, it turns out Wednesdays are a great time to go. The crowds were very low, and we had such a great time. We all ate some good fair food (the strawberry pop-tart beignetffle was a winner). Paisley won a fair game and got a giant stuffed boba tea. We saw a horse show, a magic show (meh), and did the petting zoo. The fair isn't really my jam, but the low crowds meant I didn't find it too overwhelming.</p>

<p>Elaine entered a photo competition a few weeks ago and was selected as a top-ten finalist, so we went to the event for that last night. Not a winner, but it was still exciting to be in the top ten. We ate dinner with Shelby at Red Robin after, and it was great to catch up after a long time and after all the sickness over the last couple months that we've been dealing with.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish up refinancing on the house. We should be able to save almost $300 on P&amp;I on our home, going from 7.625% to 6.125%. (Unfortunately, our taxes were also GROSSLY miscalculated, so my guess is our monthly payment will roughly stay the same AND we'll have a pretty big tax bill that we'll need to catch up on. Bummer.)</li>
<li>Find a decent budget software and actual start working on it / sticking to it with Elaine.</li>
<li>Clean out the shower (it's due for it's monthly grout cleaning)</li>
- 
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I found a YouTube Channel that has some episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnUH-yJPVuw">Britain's Best Woodworker, season 2</a>, which is fun. Sort of like that British baking show, but for woodworking.</p>

<p>When I was watching some guitar maintenance and building videos last week, I came across an old school HTML-style site that seems to have some really great info on guitar care and maintenance (diy): http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/OwnerManual/manssguitar.html</p>

<p>There are a bazillion different lists of "tools you need to buy" when starting woodworking. It's pretty dizzying, but this site really did narrow it down to a somewhat manageable list: https://woodandshop.com/learn-traditional-woodworking-with-hand-tools/getting-started-traditional-handtool-woodworking-step-1/ &lt;-- I've written the list down elsewhere but I do think that this is a helpful place to start.</p>
