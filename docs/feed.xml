  <p>I guess what I’m saying is: thanks, I hate it. Give me context; give me nuance; give me the ability to think for myself. We built the world’s most incredible communication and knowledge-sharing medium, rich with diverse perspectives and alternative ideas; let’s not sanitize it through a banal filter that is designed to strip it of its humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>--Ben Werdmuller, <a href="https://werd.io/2024/stripping-the-web-of-its-humanity">"Stripping the web of its humanity"</a></p>

<p>Not long ago at work, I made a passing comment to my teammates that the internet was humanity's best idea, but that we have been actively mucking it up for the last two decades or so. That was a bit of an overstatement on my part (after all, humanity did just fine without the web for thousands of years). But I do think the web, at its core, is still a great <em>idea</em>. As a tool, it enables knowledge sharing, especially for those who would historically have been less privileged; it bolsters the global economy and has helped us to grow in ways we could only dream of a century ago; it allows for an openness to the experience of others outside our immediate communities.</p>

<p>So, humanity's <em>best</em> idea? Probably not, but I still think it's up there in terms of <em>potential</em>.</p>

<p>My concern, however, is that we genuinely are mucking it up, and two new forms of technology -- one software, one hardware -- were released last week that only serve to confirm my feelings. </p>

<p><strong>The first is <a href="https://arc.net/blog/arc-search">Arc Search</a>.</strong> Arc is a new-ish internet browser company that really is doing new and interesting things for browsing the web. I haven't incorporated the Arc browser into my life much because my work life revolves so much around Chrome. But when I use Arc I find it pretty interesting and fun.</p>

<p>The idea behind Arc Search, however, is disappointing. Arc says of Arc Search:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Browses for you.</strong> For any search, tapping Browse for Me will scour the web, read multiple pages, and build you the perfect tab - already a fan favorite.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't even read those words without feeling bummed. In my mind, that's not what the web or search on the web is <em>for</em>. This is inevitable given the incorporation of LLMs in other search engines. But I don't <em>want</em> a search for something to result in a machine browsing for me and creating a bespoke web page for me that reduces the possible pages I might come across into a single, condensed page. The fun of surfing in the early aughts was stumbling upon things that you weren't necessarily looking for. And this whole concept of AI search not only relegates the fun part of search to a machine, you also don't get to <em>choose</em> where that condensed information is even coming from. It's chosen for you, and it's not even curated by a human being!</p>

<p><strong>The second is the new Apple Vision Pro.</strong> I'm not a reviewer of this product. I haven't touched one in person. I have seen several videos, watched the keynote, seen the product's capabilities, etc. Listen, it looks like a very interesting technological leap forward. Or as Marques Brownlee puts it in his video, it's tomorrow's technology with today's hardware. And honestly, this is the technology that Marvel (Tony Stark) and Minority report somewhat predicted in the last two decades.</p>

<p>But watching and reading reviews, where the people using the Vision Pro are immersed in a digital world is also, well, a bummer. Many folks are predicting that the headset will continue to get smaller and smaller over the next decade so as to be more discrete. The fact that this model is a "Pro" implies a non-pro, less expensive option is in the works. So it will be more widely available in the near future.</p>

<p>But practically, what does this mean? Well, we know what it means, because we already have a model from smartphones on how we progress in our use of it. First it will be sparse, then more and more folks will use it until it's ubiquitous -- a "necessity" for work, then we won't be able to imagine entertainment without it either. </p>

<p>But at the end of this, we'll see that our interactions with this technology remove or degrade social bonds, because the underlying premise is that I am immersing <em>myself</em> in this digital world, separate from my family and friends and the people around me. I am in some sense escaping (or at least augmenting) actual, objective reality because actual, objective reality is no longer enough.</p>

<p>I don't want to be a doomer about all this. My career currently requires a lively internet, and probably will flourish under this new technological landscape if I stick to digital marketing.</p>

<p>But damn if it isn't sad. These were the two top stories last week. AI has been on our societal brain for the last couple of years. We knew Apple was working on this for a while, and it came out and there is tons of hype.</p>

<p>And all I can see is a bleaker, less human web.</p>

            <title>Emergence from Modularity - Quote</title>

  <p>The prevalence of modularity in computer design, and of "emergent" strategies and techniques in software design, makes my dreams of Morlockian power seem absurdly far-fetched. If the people who design and build the microchips, construct the hardware, and write the software codes don't understand how exactly the whole thing manages to work—or, as is often the case, why it doesn't—then shouldn't I just become the most skillful computer user I can (a "power user," as the lingo has it) and forget about tinkering under the hood? After all, Johnson argues that, as self-organizing systems become more technologically dominant—a development he thinks is inevitable, especially in computer software—the ability to "accommodate uncertainty" (as Baldwin and Clark put it), to accept one's lack of control over the outcome of a given process, will become a cardinal virtue.</p>

            <title>EST - A new tag for a new personal focus</title>
            <pubDate>2024-01-19 10:30:50</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/est-a-new-tag-for-a-new-personal-focus.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/est-a-new-tag-for-a-new-personal-focus.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I am creating a new tag as of today -- <a href="https://cbaca.blog/tags/EST.html">EST</a>. This will stand for exiistentialism, secularism, and technology. All three of these subjects have interested me at different times in the last, I don't know, 8 years or so? But I have generally been interested in them as somewhat separate subjects. <strong>Existentialism</strong> was a big focus for me in the latter portion of my graduate degree, especially Kierkegaard's existential, theological epistemology during my thesis. During that time, I also discovered Charles Taylor via James K.A. Smith, and his work <em>A Secular Age</em>, which I have only partially read but find useful a way to think about modernity, <strong>secularism</strong>, and what has brought about the current shape of religious thought. Also around this same time, I discovered Neil Postman as a cultural <strong>technology</strong> critic, and found his model for thinking about our cultural uses of technology (and the ways in which those technologies <em>use us</em>) as insightful.</p>

<p>The more I think about this, the more I believe these are, or can be, interconnected modules of thought. They overlap in interesting ways. Technology affects our mode of being and acting in the world more than ever before, Secularism (Taylor's version, anyway) can be seen partially as deeply intertwined with the technological progress of the last 200 years. And I think it somewhat goes without saying how secularism and existentialism are affected by one another.</p>

<p>I imagine that I will want to think of EST as more of a long-term personal idea project, and less as a year long personal project that I will somehow summit by the end of 2024. Alan Jacobs mentioned recently (somewhere on his blog) that technopoly (a Neil Postman term to describe our cultural habits w/r/t technology) was a decade-long research interest of his.</p>

<p>But, what better place to store thoughts, links, ideas, books, and whatever else I find related to this subject than my blog? I thought about placing them in Evernote or Notion or some other tool, but I don't think those will be as resilient as my site, since this already has a structure in place, and whether or not it stays online, I will always have the Markdown and HTML files to refer back to in a structured form.</p>

            <title>Richard Beck on Existential Theology and Its Current Benefits</title>
            <pubDate>2024-01-18 10:32:48</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/richard-beck-on-existential-theology-and-its-current-benefits.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
  <p>...existential theology has done a good job of mapping the existential and experiential terrain of human experience as it relates to God. Again, existentialism points to our Augustinian restlessness. You can't live without God and not have that impact you in some existential way. We have a natural desire for a supernatural end, and that desire will always be left existentially unfulfilled until it finds rest in God. Existential theology does a great job at describing and evoking both this desire and its lack of fulfillment. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>--Richard Beck, <a href="https://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2024/01/reclaiming-existential-theology-part-5.html">"Reclaiming Existential Theology: Part 5, More Than Swallowing Horse Pills"</a></p>

<p>This is something I think I've not fully been able to articulte in the past, especially w/r/t my ongoing facscination with existentialism and in particularl Kierkegaard.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Kierkegaard's epistemological work enthralled me (and continues to) because I think he maps out a condition that <em>still</em> matters, even in 21st century modernity. Kierkegaard, I think, is a theologian first and foremost (earlier works notwithstanding). His main life's work was later in his writing, and being faithful under modern epistemological conditions was a constant source of tension for him, IMO. The "ache" or something similar to Charles Taylor's term regarding "fullness" in a secular age brings about the <em>need</em> for existential theology -- otherwise, we're perhaps speaking a disingenuous language.</p>
