    <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>The big thing this week has been prepping for my first duck hunt (ðŸ¦†)! I went last year with Zack right after Thanksgiving, but didn't have a license so I was just a bystander. We didn't bag anything last year either, so I'm hoping this is a good little trip for me. I'm SO excited, this is an experience out of my norm. I finished up my hunter's education, got my license, and set up my shotgun/accessories situation.</p>

<p>Halloween was also a fun time! I dressed as Miguel from Coco, and the girls were traditional skeletons from Dia de los Muertos. Lots of folks from the girls' school came over and we ate, passed out candy, and the girls were able to go trick or treating with their friends.</p>

<p>I'm getting reallllll close to the race (I think I'm right at 3 weeks out). My legs are a bit tired and I'm definitely feeling worn down some from training. But overall I think I am ready for the race -- my goal is still to place in the top 3 overall, but I'll be happy with a good race no matter what.</p>

<p>I took the step of deleting internet browser access from my phone, just to mitigate access to stupid feeds and news or whatever. It hasn't fully removed my proclivity for doomscrolling, but it's definitely better than it was, and my mood is anecdotally better as well.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Got the grass mowed last weekend, and that should be the last big mow for the season, thank goodness.</p>

<p>Just wanting to get through this next week mostly -- should be quick as I'm taking Thursday and Friday off, and we're hunting next Monday.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>Just bingeing <a href="https://www.themeateater.com/shows/duck-camp-dinners">Duck Camp Dinners</a>, Jean-Paul Bourgeois is the man, and it's just hyping me up for hunting season.</p>
