  <p>...existential theology has done a good job of mapping the existential and experiential terrain of human experience as it relates to God. Again, existentialism points to our Augustinian restlessness. You can't live without God and not have that impact you in some existential way. We have a natural desire for a supernatural end, and that desire will always be left existentially unfulfilled until it finds rest in God. Existential theology does a great job at describing and evoking both this desire and its lack of fulfillment. </p>

<p>This is something I think I've not fully been able to articulte in the past, especially w/r/t my ongoing facscination with existentialism and in particularl Kierkegaard.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Kierkegaard's epistemological work enthralled me (and continues to) because I think he maps out a condition that <em>still</em> matters, even in 21st century modernity. Kierkegaard, I think, is a theologian first and foremost (earlier works notwithstanding). His main life's work was later in his writing, and being faithful under modern epistemological conditions was a constant source of tension for him, IMO. The "ache" or something similar to Charles Taylor's term regarding "fullness" in a secular age brings about the <em>need</em> for existential theology -- otherwise, we're perhaps speaking a disingenuous language.</p>

  <p>But the absolute opposite of “cool” is not “uncool” but “cringe”: the wincing, jaw-clenching feeling you get when you do, or witness, something that you know the cool people would regard not just as uncool, but actively anti-cool: embarrassing, awkward, social Kryptonite. And while babies merely uncool, probably the most cringe thing you can do is going to church. There, you show up regularly to join a group of others you didn’t choose, and some of whom are probably old, or weird, or awkward, or otherwise uncool. The purpose of showing up is prayer: again, the opposite of cool, because to pray is to declare, openly, that you are not completely self-contained.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Some links on the state of personal websites and blogging:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many people are now desperately waiting for their Twitter archives, hoping that they’ll arrive before all their content is lost for good. For those who were using Twitter primarily for ephemeral chatter, all this isn’t that tragic. But for others, all their posts, conversations, and connections on the social network were a significant part of their online identity. They are about to lose a place on the Web into which they put a huge amount of time, attention, and energy...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how about we make 2023 the year of the personal website? The year in which we launch our first site or redesign our old one, publish a little more often, and add RSS and Webmentions to our websites so that we can write posts back and forth. The year we make our sites more fussy, more quirky, and more personal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>--<a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-year-of-the-personal-website">"The Year of the Personal Website"</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In those days, it was really simple. You could sign up for a free site on GeoCities, Yahoo, Blogger, Diaryland, or any of a number of free hosting sites that allowed you to set up your blog, get going with a WYSIWYG editor, and send your thoughts out into the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those who were a little more adventurous, you could purchase an actual domain name, pay for website hosting, and go for it that way...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bring back personal blogging in 2023. We, as a web community, will be all that much better for it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real web is built on links. Hyper ones, in fact. Links you can share on your website. Links you can send to your mates. Links to pages that can be indexed by search engines so you can find things again (in theory)...</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The real web, the small web, the indie web is amazing. Don't give Facebook and the rest of these clowns your content. Don't give them the time or your attention. Get a blog, a website, a Mastodon account, something you control, and share links to cool things you find.</p>

<p>My only quibble (and I believe I've noted this before) is that personal blogging / having a personal website needs to be <em>easy</em> for regular people. If we're going to really push this personal web thing again, blogging shouldn't be inaccessible to people that aren't bent towards wanting to mess around with markup and code. I happen to like that stuff, so building this was fine for me. But there are other people with other thoughts that should find it ultra-easy, even frictionless, to build a site and a blog. To that end, here is a list of resources for doing so from Robb Knight:</p>

  <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> - free
  <a href="https://pika.page/">Pika</a> - free

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
  <p>Because of these deep resonances with existentialism, I was also attracted to, and am still attracted to, the existentialism in the theology of Paul Tillich. I vibed for a long time with the existential "death of God" theologies. There was a similar attraction for me in the theologies of William Stringfellow and Arthur McGill. I've always been interested in theologians who place death (rather than guilt) at the existential center of the human predicament. Death is also what drew me toward Orthodox theology as seen in my book The Slavery of Death. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Excited for this series from Richard Beck. His earlier work that sought to make connections between existential psychology and theology were compelling to me as I was working out a way to maintain faith in my mid-to-late twenties.</p>

<p>Also, I don't think I ever made such a clear connection in my head as to why both existentialism and "death" as a concept or centering idea were both equally fascinating to me. Death disturbs me much like it probably does anyone else, but I also find the idea of "memento mori" in the Stoic and Christian traditions incredibly helpful for orienting and reorienting one's life. And existentialism, especially the proto-existentialism of Kierkegaard still animates my reason for considering faith to be a primary part of my life. I just never connected the two together in such a clear way.</p>
