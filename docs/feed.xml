            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I came across an issue today with the generator I've written. If I write multiple posts in a day, the RSS feed may not pick up the newest post, because all the original post dates were set to today's date, but a time of 00:00:00 CST. So if it doesn't sort it properly, a feed reader may not pick up the newest post of the day because it could get pushed to the bottom of the list of today's posts instead of the top.</p>

<p>To fix that, I introduced datetimes to my "create a post" script, and then had to manipulate that datetime string to do what I needed in the creation of the data structures for the site. E.g., I wanted only the date (not the time) to show up on the index page, but I want them in order of writing in reverse. I also wanted the feed to be in reverse order of writing so that even if I post multiple times a day, feed readers will pick up the newest post.</p>

<p>The problem is, I have multiple functions doing the work of creating posts, manipulating data, creating the index page vs. the RSS feed vs. actual posts. But there is a single reference list of dictionaries I'm passing into these functions. In the script, my "make<em>index" function happens upstream of the "make</em>rss" function. And even though the index function was getting the right order, somehow, after I was passing in and manipulating the data in the function, the <em>original list</em> was getting manipulated even though I assigned it to a new variable.</p>

<p>Apparently, this is a feature/bug in Python (I'm sure someone <em>likes</em> that this happens in Python... I didn't experience that particular joy today). For example, if I have a list of lists called "posts" and then say posts<em>copy = posts, if I manipulate values within the posts</em>copy list, any values I change there <em>will also change</em> the values in the reference list. That's bonkers, but whatever. After a couple of hours of cursing the void, I found my answer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68712435/changes-made-in-python-list-showing-up-in-copy-of-original-list">here</a>. Not only do you need to assign the values to a new variable, you have to make a "deepcopy" of the original list and assign it (if the list in question has other data structures inside it). So instead of</p>

<p>`</p>

<pre><code>posts_copy = copy
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>I needed to do:</p>

<p>`</p>

<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy

posts_copy = deepcopy(posts)
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>From there, I was able to manipulate values in the function without worrying about overwriting data in the original list.</p>

<p>I like programming, but that was maddening.</p>

    <p>Twitter right now is mainly about Twitter but also a little about Mastodon. And Mastodon is mainly about Mastodon but also a lot about Twitter.

<p>-- <a href="https://social.ayjay.org/2022/11/18/twitter-right-now.html">Alan Jacobs</a></p>

<p>Yeah, agreed. I hadn't been on Twitter in while, but jumped to Mastodon just to check things out and see if it could operate differently than Twitter. My observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Mastodon is better than Twitter in many ways.</em> Built in RSS feeds for accounts, ActivityPub compatible so it's genuinely federated, no quote tweeting, better moderation (similar to the better Reddit communities).</li>
<li><em>Mastodon doesn't quite live up to what I want it to be.</em> What I wanted was, perhaps, a way for people to be self-hosted but have a local space where that stuff got sent and you could just check in and see what others are thinking or up to.</li>
<li><em>Lots of people at Mastodon are just talking about Twitter.</em> I actually had to filter out posts that mention the word, but then there are people that call it the "bird site" or talk about Elon or whatever. I want Mastodon to be more than that but maybe that will take some time.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm also not convinced Mastodon won't become a sort of Twitter 2.0. Maybe not quite as hateful or outrageous, but still chaotic. I've been considering trying micro.blog instead to see if that would function closer to what I want out of the web. It seesm like it's possible that service is closer than Mastodon.</p>

            <title>Fitness Update</title>
            <pubDate>11/18/2022</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/fitness-update.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/fitness-update.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>A general fitness update:</p>

<p>I've been working out consistently 8/22/22, which is right at 13 weeks. The first few weeks, I was using the <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/">r/Fitness Basic Routine</a>. This was helpful just for getting into weightlifting again (I haven't lifted weights since high school!). It helped lower the barrier and increase my confidence since I was just relearning a few basic barbell moves.</p>

<p>After a few weeks, my confidence was high enough that I was able to switch over to a routine that I felt better suited my needs. r/Fitness doesn't recommend it, but I decided to go with <a href="stronglifts.com">StrongLifts 5x5</a>, since it seemed like a logical step up. Roughly the same basic barbell lifts:</p>

<h3>A Day</h3>

<ol>
<li>Squat</li>
<li>Bench Press</li>
<li>Barbell Rows</li>
</ol>

<h3>B Day</h3>

<ol>
<li>Squat</li>
<li>Overhead Press</li>
<li>Deadlift</li>
</ol>

<p>You can go to his site for more details. But the basic idea is, start with really low weight on all lifts (the bar if you can, or a little bit of weight if it needs to be off the floor). Every move is 5 sets of 5 reps with the same weight. The next time you do that move, you increase the weight by 5lbs (2.5 weights on each side). Pure linear progression until your form breaks down or you can't lift the weight. Within a few weeks, I felt good enough to also add in extra arm work (A day: dips and skullcrushers, B day: chin ups and barbell or dumbbell curls). </p>

<h3>Postives / Wins</h3>

<ul>
<li>My chin ups have increased drastically. Before I started lifting, I could only do 1-2 chin ups. I can now do roughly 3 sets of 5 or 6 with no assistance, and that's after I do heavy lifting.</li>
<li>Deadlift is currently sitting at around 165 lbs.</li>
<li>I'm seeing body changes which are really cool. I haven't seen real upper body tone on me in a loooooooong time. It's nice to feel like I have muscles and to feel strong.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Negatives / Struggles</h3>

<ul>
<li>Currently dealing with ann anterior hip flexor issue. It seems like it might have been caused by bad squat form. I've fixed that (I think), but it's gonna take a while to heal, so I'm sticking around the 115-130 range for my squats.</li>
<li>Overhead press has been stalled for weeks now. I made it to about 65-70 lbs but just can't get 5x5. </li>
</ul>

<p>I can see why r/Fitness overall doesn't recommened StrongLifts. Honestly, I think it's a great program for someone starting out. It's simple, effective for building quick strength, and it's a quick workout (mine are usually 45-55 minutes). But I think the deload program doesn't really work. This is obvious by the OHP struggles I'm having. I also think it's possible that for many people who lack strength, growing your squat weight that quickly and squatting so often has the potential for injuring you if you aren't careful or don't listen to your body.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, my goal is really to support other activities I want to do (mainly, running and climbing). I'll continue doing StrongLifts for at least another 2 weeks to finish out 12 full weeks on the program, but I may end up switching to <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/">Jim Wendler's 5/3/1</a> or the <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/gzclp/">GZCL program</a>. My only concern with those are the time commitment. I just don't have more than an hour or so in the mornings, and that's when I'm working out. But either way, I'm trying to play the long game here. I want to be strong and healthy, not necessarily make my life revolve around being "a weightlifter."</p>

  <p>Domestic cozy is in an attitude, emerging socioeconomic posture, and aesthetic, that is in many ways the antithesis of premium mediocrity. Unsurprisingly, it takes its cues from the marginal shadow behaviors of premium mediocrity. It finds its best expression in privacy, among friends, rather than in public, among strangers. It prioritizes the needs of the actor rather than the expectations of the spectator. It seeks to predictably control a small, closed environment rather than gamble in a large, open one. It presents a WYSIWYG facade to those granted access rather than performing in a theater of optics.</p>

            <title>TIL: 11-16-22</title>
            <pubDate>11/16/2022</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/til-11-16-22.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/til-11-16-22.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Well, today was a cool day. Since making the <a href="https://github.com/cdbaca/ssg">static site generator</a>, my goal has been to move the actual website content pages (plus styling/scripts) to my own VPS. I really wasn't sure where to start for a long time. But then I came across <a href="landchad.net">LandChad</a>. Now, the owner of this site holds to some views that I find pretty unagreeable. I won't link to his home page, because I went down that rabbit hole and it wasn't the most wholesome content... Nevertheless, he offers a ton of legitimately helpful advice on getting started with a virtual private server (VPS).</p>

<p>I made my way through grabbing a domain name (via NameCheap), purchasing droplet space from DigitalOcean, and away I went. Honestly, it really wasn't that bad. The kicker for most people, I think, is that you need some familiarity with Linux-based systems and working in the terminal rather than a GUI for managing files. But it was cool because I was able to set up nginx, which is the actual web server on the VPS that I'm using. I'd read about nginx before but it seemed like gobbledygook. The other thing I'll need to keep learning is how to use ssh effectively. SSH is a method for remoting into a non-local server or computer and managing files remotely. I found <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1087936439470444544/photo/1">Julie Evans' cartoon</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpk_1gldOAE">Corey Shafer's video on ssh</a> really hepful here.</p>

<p>Next goals will be to use the server for other things: maybe storage or automating tasks when my laptops are put away. I also want to host a full-blown Django or Flask app. This blog is built by hand on my local computer, and the domain you're reading is just plain ol' vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. Django will change that up with doing server-side work. I plan to use <a href="https://mattsegal.dev/simple-django-deployment-1.html">Matt Segal's Django deployment guide</a> for that.</p>
