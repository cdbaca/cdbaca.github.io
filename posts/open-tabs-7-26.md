[Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com) says in *Steal Like an Artist* that you ought to keep a swipe file for anything you find interesting, useful, etc. I'm not very good at that. Usually I have like 20 tabs open, then I forget about them till later and then have to clean them up or forget why I was interested in the first place.

Maybe a blog is a good place to keep a swipe file? Let's see. Maybe eventually I'll just have a dedicated page/section to this stuff if it gets big enough.
