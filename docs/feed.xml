            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I think anyone who listens to synth-y, tech-y, 80s-vibe music on YouTube has come across "Resonance" by Home.</p>

<p>This is such a strange, weird, nostalgia-inducing piece of music. Every time I listen to it, I experience unexplainable feelings of longing and melancholy. It's very strange for a piece of music to do that, but there you have it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm still taking a trip in my <a href="https://cbaca.blog/spotify-the-time-machine.html">Spotify time machine</a> and came across the album <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Nz9gdj35Unk1AbfL8Igmx?si=azvxpfevQoumuccsolhM_A"><em>Odyssey</em> by Home</a>, which I discovered after the YouTube algorithm so graciously gifted my with "Resonance." It's pretty great -- many of the songs also have that retro feel and its instrumental nature lends itself to being able to continute to focus at work while I listen.</p>

            <title>Computer Science Education Links</title>
            <pubDate>2023-10-24 11:13:00</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Working tech-adjacent in digital marketing, and with a lot of data, has made me think about what kind of education would be beneficial from this point forward. My thoughts keep leading me back to computer science, since that's really the baseline for all the work I'm doing now. If I want to go deeper in data engineering or move more into the web dev/software sphere, I think I'm going to need a deeper understanding of computation, design patterns, algorithms, and so on for me to be genuinely useful in roles with more/deeper responsibility. </p>

<p>Part of the reason for this, I think, is because I've tried to start some education in cloud data engineering and the truth is I just have so many gaps in my knowledge. It's very possible I've brought myself to the edge of where I can go by just trying shit out, and a somewhat more formal or structured approach will help to fill out those areas where I'm lacking.</p>

<p>To that end, I just found a few links that I think could be helpful. Daunting, but each link offers what essentially amounts to a full computer science education for (mostly) free.</p>

            <title>Spotify the Time Machine</title>
            <pubDate>2023-10-23 09:08:14</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/spotify-the-time-machine.html</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>One of my consistent tech habits that I'm actually glad about is my obsession with trying to keep up with new music that I come across. It's not always "new" music -- more "new to me." Generally, if I come across an album or single or something that I think I might enjoy, I throw it into this month's folder in Spotify.</p>

<p>Every year, at the beginning of the year, I make a new playlist folder titled "New Music [insert year]." Within that folder, each month gets its own playlist, so, January 2023 all the way through December 2023, for example.</p>

<p>I'm not willy-nilly about what goes in the playlists, but I'm also not overly picky. Basically, I scour the New Releases every Friday to see if anything has released that's interesting (Blink-182's new album is a good example of this). If it looks like something I might listen to, it gets thrown into this month's playlist. I also use these playlists for music that's new to me, so anytime I come across an album or single song I enjoy, I move the album into this month's playlist as well.</p>

<p>This has actually been really fun, because I can look back on a year and see what "stuck" and what didn't I can also find stuff that I meant to listen to but forgot that I found. This helps to keep me paying attention to new music as well. I wouldn't call myself obsessed with music, but I certainly love it about 1000x more than podcasts or audiobooks.</p>

<p>I was also thinking this morning about how much I enjoy the fact that I can look back at older years and see what caught my attention. There is plenty of music that was released back in 2017, for example, that I listened to a lot that year but then it slowly faded away. This morning, I'm listening to the soundtrack from the iPhone game <em>Monument Valley 2</em>. The soundscapes are great; it's synth-y, emotional, and instrumental, so it makes for great focus music. But on top of that, my yearly new music playlists turn into a bit of a time machine. Not to put too fine a point on it, but there is some sense of being "taken back" to that time when I first discovered the album, and all the subsequent times I listened to it.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways current tech lends itself to poor habits of the mind. But sometimes, I do think new technology makes our lives just a little bit better. This focused way of using Spotify is definitely something I appreciate.</p>

    <p>If you’re reading the news several times a day, you’re not being <em>informed</em>, you’re being <em>stimulated</em>. Try giving yourself a break from it. Look at this stuff at wider intervals, and in between sessions, give yourself time to think and assess. </p>

<p>--Alan Jacobs, <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/periodicity/">"Periodicity"</a></p>

<p>A good point in a week of terrible news. Leaving social media (including, for the most part, Reddit) has been really beneficial for my mental well being. And I often wonder about the notion of "being informed." Being informed <em>about what</em>? <em>By whom</em>? And <em>for what purpose</em>? </p>

<p>With what seems to be a literally insane amount of misinformation (read: lies and ignorant claims) being promulgated on social media platforms and news sites, I'm just not convinced it is good or right for any of us to be aware on an hour by hour basis about what's going on outside of our immediate, local communities.</p>

            <title>Addiction to Audience</title>
            <pubDate>2023-10-18 10:05:52</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
  <p>every tweet, every selfie is a chance to virtue signal, an opportunity to market yourself as someone — pundit, guru, genius, or goofball. There is no other way of putting it — we are addicted to the idea of an audience. When we go online, we are programmed to react to engagement triggers — likes, shares, retweets, hearts, and thumb-ups. Social and this addiction of audience have made us addicted to something even harder to give up once tasted: a constant feeling of self-importance. To live in this post-social future, one has to embrace ideas that are the antithesis of self-importance. After two decades of being trained by micro-dosing on dopamine, I am not sure we can!</p>

<p>--Om Malik, <a href="https://om.co/2022/01/12/can-we-ever-become-post-social/">"Can We Ever Become Post-Social?"</a></p>

<p>Like I said yesterday, the internet's transformations over the last two decades has formed us into not wanting to write or create or do on the web without an audience. And that sucks.</p>
