>>The web I want is powered by passion, not money. The web I want doesn't need to ask for permission to track me because they know that tracking me is not the right thing to do. The web I want doesn't make me waste bandwidth by loading pointless video autoplaying in the background. The web I want doesn't try to suck me into an endless, mindless scrolling. The web I want doesn't need to resort to clickbait headlines. The web I want doesn't care about useless metrics like clicks or views. The web I want cares about human flourishing. The web I want is inspiring. The web I want still exists. The web I want is still out there to be found. The web I want is made by people, by great people, by creative people, by interesting people. People like you.
