>>Now that the white-hot fire of Twitter is burning itself out, and its various alternatives (Threads, Bluesky, Mastodon) are generating merely gentle (or sputtering) flames, and TikTok (which is not a social-media site in any meaningful sense but rather a media-consumption platform) is still going nova, this is the time for people to rediscover the pleasures of blogging – of writing at whatever length you want, and posting photos, and embedding videos, and linking to music playlists, all on your little corner of the internet.

>>Let’s bring back the blog. And leave all the bad things spawned by the blogosphere to social media, where they belong.

See, the thing is, I think the blog is already back. Just because social media giants (and [the small guys too](https://joinmastodon.org/)) are taking up most of the discourse w/r/t web interaction doesn't mean the blog is not back. Thankfully, most of the interesting stuff I find now isn't through social media anymore. It's still through RSS, and still through indie blogs run by regular ol' people like you and me.

I think the only thing I'd really like to see is an easier way / lower barrier for entry into indie blogging. I can figure out how to put together [a little static site generator of my own](https://github.com/cdbaca/ssg), and blog through my terminal and text files. I doubt most regular folks can do that. And my sense is that Wordpress and other tools like it are too heavy for most folks' use.

I did find [this little tool](https://blot.im/) the other day (via my RSS feed, via an indie blog!) which is pretty cool and simple. Looks as easy as having a couple folders on your computer, linking to something like Dropbox, and syncing up the folders once you've written a post or shared an image.

Anyway, to the original point of this post -- blogging might have done a little hibernating while we all experimented with a few sites that functioned as somewhat-global town squares. But my sense is that it is reawakening and ready to give us a warm, cozy hug when we are ready for it again.
