Kendrick Lamar released *Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers* two weeks ago, after a five-year hiatus. A few thoughts:

- Anyone listening should be able to tell that this album was written by a man struggling with grief, pain,
  mistakes, cultural and societal expectations, and being a human being.
- Primary themes:
  1. Therapy
  2. Grief
  3. Loss
  4. Self-esteem
  5. Lust & greed
  6. Anger & resentment
  7. Regret
  8. Responsibilities & external expectations
- Can anyone imagine the pressure someone like Kendrick Lamar must be under? The guy set out to make music and art
  that speaks to the soul and the internal struggle of being good person in a mad world. As he did so, people latched 
  onto him as a prophet, the current king of rap, a potential savior.
- Kendrick, better than any other artist I know, is incredible at having something to say about the world and what is
  wrong with it, and then turning that lens right back on himself and seeing that he's the problem too. If you really
  listen to *TPAB*, *Damn*, and *GKMC*, I mean really pay attention, you'll understand that he's only calling out 
  society as a whole when he has already spent the time calling himself out.

The best artists aren't the ones pointing their finger at the rest of the world to blame "society" or "culture" or 
"them" for what's wrong. They're the ones that do that *while simultaneously* flipping the script and looking internally 
and seeing those same ills in themselves. Unfortunately for Kendrick, no one wants to hear that message right now. It's a lot harder
to self-reflect and change oneself than it is to be pissed off on Twitter or become an overnight activist. And even
though Kendrick is doing his best to shed the crown that people tried to give him after _TPAB_ and _Damn_, I think 
it likely that he'll continue to be seen as a prophet because he's still doing the hard work of saying the things no one 
wants to hear.
