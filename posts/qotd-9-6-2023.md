>>Real knowldge arises through confrontations with real things. Work, then, offers a broadly available premonition of philosophy. Its value, however, does not lie solely in pointing to some more rarefied experience. Rather, in the best cases, work may itself approach the good sough in philosophy, understood as a way of life: a community of those who desire to know.

--Matthew B. Crawford, *Shop Class as Soul Craft*
