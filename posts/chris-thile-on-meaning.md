>I can't quite shake the sense of a governing pulse. That there is such a thing... that there is some sort of almighty pulse that we're all kind of moving to, whether we're aware of it or not. Sort of ostensibly, I'd say I'm an agnostic. And I live accordingly. But i also have a firm conviction that this is not random or meaningless. And I couldn't tell you why I have that conviction. Maybe it's as simple as it makes me happier to think that there is a reason for all of this. And I am naive enough to where that's gonna color my worldview more than anything else.

>I do think there is a part of me that would embrace nihilism kind of wholesale, just intellectually. But I don't like the ripples that sends out from me. I don't like how that affects the people around me... It's like, I can feel the pulse in a nihilistic place, but I'm not gonna put it there, because I don't like how that sounds.
