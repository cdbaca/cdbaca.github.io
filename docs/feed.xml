The web I want is inspiring. The web I want still exists. The web I want is still out there to be found. The web I want is made by people, by great people, by creative people, by interesting people.

            <title>Social Web</title>
            <pubDate>2023-07-21 09:48:01</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/social-web.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/social-web.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Had a thought this morning that I wanted to jot down.</p>

<p>Truly being social -- like, out in the real world, i.e., making plans, spending time with people who share and do not share our interests, etc. -- <em>requires</em> friction. Being social is at least some amount of work. It should be easy in some ways, but the act of getting together, of managing schedules, of putting time aside, of having conversations, of being awkward... those are all kind of icky sometimes.</p>

<p>The social web that we've known has essentially tried to reduce all that friction down to zero. Algorithms make decisions for you -- what you see, whose thoughts you see, when you see it. Notifications take away the friction of thinking about the folks you want to talk to and have relationships with. Like buttons take away the requirement of figuring out where our friends stand on things and what they might think about us.</p>

<p>As I was surfing throough some blogs the other day, I realized that there was lot more friction there. You get caught in loops, hit dead ends, you rely on who other people know and what they've come across. There are no machines <em>guiding</em> your path. The path is created by following what catches your eye.</p>

<p>Maybe a better social web is frictiony. Maybe more friction, not less, is what we need to recover some of what we've lost.</p>

      <p>In 2004, most people weren’t viewing the internet through a bunch of social networks and algorithmic feeds. Facebook and Twitter were barely blips on the radar. At that point, most people experienced the internet by typing in URLs and going to websites. A few tools like NetNewsWire and Bloglines had cropped up to make it easier to subscribe to lots of sites in one place, but these RSS readers were mostly tools for nerds. Most users were stuck managing bookmarks and browser windows and furiously refreshing their favorite sites just to see what was new. Wetherell’s prototype wasn’t complicated like NetNewsWire, it didn’t crash like Bloglines, and the Javascript interface felt fast and smooth. It immediately felt like a better way to keep up with the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23778253/google-reader-death-2013-rss-social">"Who Killed Google Reader?"</a></p>

<p>Makes me want to build an RSS reader. Also makes me wonder if the internet could have been just a little bit different had Google thrown what they had at this thing. Maybe that's naive or idealistic, but a social network built around following real things, perhaps built a bit more organically, sounds pretty pleasant given all the current shit out there.</p>

            <title>Building vs. Using</title>
            <pubDate>2023-07-16 12:46:03</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/building-vs-using.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/building-vs-using.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>I think about this blog all the time, but have had very little time to use it. (<em>nota bene</em>: Starting a new job that takes a lot of mental energy may have something to do with it.)</p>

<p>In fact, I did recently pick up the backend side of the blog recently, when we were on our <strong>Great Midwest Tour of 2023</strong> -- perhaps there will be a post about that in the future.</p>

<p>But I just wanted to make a note here as it struck me while I was reading a Substack post from John Warner titled <a href="https://biblioracle.substack.com/p/building-a-creative-practice">"Building a Creative Practice"</a> (h/t <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/i-dont-want-to-be-the-best">Austin Kleon</a>, as usual). In the post, John writes about what it means to "be creative" and mentions how he and his brother were very different as children in terms of which you would have thought was the more creative kid. John Warner, a writer now, was not "traditionally" creative where his brother (who is now a lawyer) was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As adults, given my work, I’m supposedly the creative one, but no one would’ve said that when we were kids, and if you asked him, he’d probably be able to tell you the ways thinking creatively have helped him professionally.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>But I’m still stuck. If we’re not going to judge creativity by the outcome of a particular act that generates a painting, picture, poem, song, story, etc…how do we recognize its existence?</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing this made me think of was this blog itself and the work it took to create it. I find it interesting that I very much enjoyed the process of building out the back end of it. Simple as it is, it took (dare I say) <em>some</em> skill. A little Python here, a little server knowledger there, with a sprinkle of command line knowldge. All of that I found quite appealing.</p>

<p>And then I blogged for some time because that was fun too. I still enjoy it somewhat, but I don't think I actually enjoy the act of <em>using</em> the blog as much as I enjoyed <em>building</em> the blog. And perhaps part of the reason I felt strange about that is because I saw writing as inherently creative where I saw the building of the tool as not as creative. It seems silly to write that out, because logically I know that both are equally creative acts. But there is something about the writing thing that sticks in my brain as a more creative act than getting in the weeds of the tech required to build this thing.</p>
