            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>Personally, not much activity happening, which is to say: this was basically a routine sort of week. That's not a bad thing, but I can't think of much that was "of note." </p>

<p>I'm entering the final phase of training, which means I hit another 12 miler last Saturday, and will move into my final two long runs before my taper for the Dino Valley 25K.</p>

<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-We-Cease-Understand-World/dp/1681375664"><em>When We Cease to Understand the World</em></a> by Benjamin Labatut. I was reading <em>Persepolis Rising</em>, the 7th book in The Expanse saga, but I'm either just not ready for the book or I'm bored with the characters. In theory, a long, sprawling epic story is interesting and consuming. In practice (maybe it's just these authors), this is along time to spend with these characters, and I'm finding the writing style a bit... mediocre?</p>

<p>I did receive some new woodworking tools in this week! I think this completes the "basic collection" that I need to be able to <em>actually</em> start making things. This week's haul included a block plane, a shoulder plane, a coping saw, and some more measuring/marking tools. My first goal is to build <a href="https://www.freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/bookstand">this book stand</a>, and perhaps a dovetail box after that. We'll see where it takes me! I do think project-based work, even if I'm bad at it, is going to be the best way forward here to gain the skills I'm currently lacking.</p>

<p>Work was work-y. Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>P is doing really great. I'm seeing so much growth in her over the last couple of months. I think Elaine and I are both feeling a little reticent to "look at it straight on" in fear of things returning to how they used to be. We had years of tough, and months of REALLY tough. But there are signs from her that things are genuinely looking up and hopeful.</p>

<p>Lyla and I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 last night. We finished the entire book series months and months ago, and have slowly eked our way through the movies.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<p>Same as last week.</p>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I learned today about a music genre called "shoegaze," which seems to be described best by listening to "Mayonaise" by Smashing Pumpkins. I've been looking for a genre that encapsulates the feel of that song for a long time, so this'll be  a fun rabbit hole (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX6ujZpAN0v9r?si=2be64f8294614e0b">Spotify playlist to match</a>).</p>

<p>Lots of stuff I'm running into re: avoiding news consumption and online feeds. Wherever this is coming from... I should probably listen. We're less than two weeks out from the election, and the truth is I've been feeling the need to step back from even Reddit/NYT consumption, which are the last vestiges of daily news/daily feeds in my routine. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We are not rational enough to be exposed to the
    news-mongering press. It is a very dangerous
    thing, because the probabilistic mapping we get
    from consuming news is entirely different from
    the actual risks that we face. Watching an airplane
    crash on television is going to change your attitude
    toward that risk regardless of its real probability,
    no matter your intellectual sophistication. If you
    think you can compensate for this bias with the
    strength of your own inner contemplation, you are
    wrong. Bankers and economists – who have
    powerful incentives to compensate for newsborne hazards – have shown that they cannot. The
    only solution: cut yourself off from news
    consumption entirely.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--Rolf Dobelli, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf">"Avoid News: Toward a Healthy News Diet"</a></p>

<p>^ Written in 2010; I'd argue in 2024 this is just as applicable to infinite-feed sites. (Reddit being my personal number one culprit that I'm having trouble kicking.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As I've written before, alarming news is nothing new, but the central place the news has come to occupy in many people's psychological worlds is certainly novel. Because of how digital media works – though also because the news developments themselves are legitimately huge – these global dramas start to feel like life's centre of gravity, with the immediate worlds of family, job and neighborhood relegated to the periphery.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>--Oliver Burkeman, <a href="https://ckarchive.com/b/r8u8hoh8eeov">"Becoming News-Resilient"</a></p>

<p>One of the things making me think about this right now is just how much I feel like my actual view of reality has been/is being warped by news &amp; media feeds. I know it's election season and these feelings are especially potent for everyone right now. I just want to approach life both calmly and <em>realistically</em>. One may argue that being informed helps with at least the latter, but I find that doubtful.</p>

<p>Lord grant me strength to avoid the bullshit.</p>

            <title>Weeknote 4 - 5 to 18 Oct 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-10-19 12:01:39</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-4-5-to-18-oct-2024.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-4-5-to-18-oct-2024.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>Even as I start writing this, I'm realizing how difficult it is to reach back two weeks ago to try to remember what was happening. Here's what I can remember:</p>

<p>The big thing was the end of the cross country season! We made our way to Georgetown last Friday (why I didn't write a weeknote last week), and the junior high and high school teams performed really well. We had a high school girl win her whole division in state, and lots of other runners place and medal in the top 8. Proud of the kids... and also happy the season is over :)</p>

<p>We are in the process of refinancing our mortage -- which we seem to have done at just the right time as rates seem to be rising (??) again. Everything looks like it's going to go through, and we're going to save something like $270 per month on our payment, which is really cool.</p>

<p>I finished a woodworking project! Using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiMjv7lkqI">Rex Krueger's guide to making a Roman-style workbench</a>, I was able to complete this over the course of working on it on and off for the last couple weeks. I made a lot of mistakes, it doesn't exactly look pretty, but it works! Which is a pretty good feeling.</p>

<p>Once I get a couple more work holding options for the bench and a few more tools (said every woodworking hobbyist ever), I think I'll actually be able to make some of the projects that have caught my eye over the last year or so.</p>

<p>Work has been... fine. There is nothing inherently <em>bad</em> about it. I still enjoy my team, LOVE the flexibility, etc. But I'm realizing that I have hit a strange plateau point. There aren't things that I could come across, as of now, that I couldn't just handle with relative ease on my own. That has historically been a challenging time for me in any job I've held, so this is probably going to be a recurring theme until I can figure out how to hit that "sweet spot" at work again.</p>

<p>Training for the Dino Valley 25K is in its most intense training block. I hit 12 miles this morning, and have another few weeks of ramped intensity before I can back down into a taper. My legs are feeling it, but I'm feeling pretty good about my chances of placing top 3 overall. But we will see! Goal A is top 3, goal B is sub 2:04, goal C is finish with a smile on my face.</p>

<p>Elaine and I have had the chance to take every Wednesday to spend time together. Every other Wednesday is our "pastorate" (All Saints Dallas's version of small groups), and on the off weeks we are taking a date night. It has been wonderful.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Currently working on the color run at the girls' school. My job is to create the course, procure cones, and just think about the logistics of the run itself.</li>
<li>I <em>think</em> there is still time to plant the fall garden (seems like it may be a warmer-than-average winter), so we should probably get on that this weekend.</li>
<li>I really need to mow, but... lol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new Bon Iver EP: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Cwxsws0uZcu61gliYLOEm?si=-dtr6l14Q2mAS3u3HO4scQ">SABLE,</a></li>
<li>Watching The Penguin. Maybe not <em>excellent</em> but it is fun.</li>
<li>Finished <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/moonbound/introduction/"><em>Moonbound</em></a> by Robin Sloan, recommended.</li>
<li>This PBS show, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/woodwrights-shop-roman-work-bench/"><em>The Woodwright's Shop</em></a> &lt;-- This is a link to a specific episode where Chris Shwarz is demonstrating how to use a Roman workbench, but other episodes are fun too. Boy do I love public television sometimes.</li>
<li>There is a new coffee shop in our little town that is <em>excellent</em>: <a href="https://bloomandpour.com/">Bloom &amp; Pour</a>. We know one of the owners, and I'm so happy Waxahachie has a space like this, finally.</li>

            <title>Weeknote 3 - 28 Sept to 4 Oct 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-10-04 13:59:46</pubDate>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>This is the second to last week of cross country. While I love cross country so much, I'm also ready to be done with early wake up calls and long Saturdays. Now onto the end of my race training!</p>

<p>In trying to decide on a woodworking bench design, I remembered that I had already bought the material a while back for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiMjv7lkqI">Rex Krueger's low Roman-style bench</a>. While it's basic and will not meet all the needs I'll have for woodworking, it's:</p>

<p>a) a start, which is what I really need and,
b) "free" since the materials have already been bought</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this in spare little free moments I have -- 20 minutes here, 30 minutes there. I figure it's the only real way I'll be able to actually pursue a hobby that's a craft and not just wasting my time. Once the bench is built I'm hoping to learn to cut some more precise joints, and maybe make a few of the projects from <a href="https://www.freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/">Matt Estlea's free woodworking school</a>.</p>

<p>I took Wednesday off and we all went to the Texas State Fair. Besides the heat, it turns out Wednesdays are a great time to go. The crowds were very low, and we had such a great time. We all ate some good fair food (the strawberry pop-tart beignetffle was a winner). Paisley won a fair game and got a giant stuffed boba tea. We saw a horse show, a magic show (meh), and did the petting zoo. The fair isn't really my jam, but the low crowds meant I didn't find it too overwhelming.</p>

<p>Elaine entered a photo competition a few weeks ago and was selected as a top-ten finalist, so we went to the event for that last night. Not a winner, but it was still exciting to be in the top ten. We ate dinner with Shelby at Red Robin after, and it was great to catch up after a long time and after all the sickness over the last couple months that we've been dealing with.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish up refinancing on the house. We should be able to save almost $300 on P&amp;I on our home, going from 7.625% to 6.125%. (Unfortunately, our taxes were also GROSSLY miscalculated, so my guess is our monthly payment will roughly stay the same AND we'll have a pretty big tax bill that we'll need to catch up on. Bummer.)</li>
<li>Find a decent budget software and actual start working on it / sticking to it with Elaine.</li>
<li>Clean out the shower (it's due for it's monthly grout cleaning)</li>
- 
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I found a YouTube Channel that has some episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnUH-yJPVuw">Britain's Best Woodworker, season 2</a>, which is fun. Sort of like that British baking show, but for woodworking.</p>

<p>When I was watching some guitar maintenance and building videos last week, I came across an old school HTML-style site that seems to have some really great info on guitar care and maintenance (diy): http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/OwnerManual/manssguitar.html</p>

<p>There are a bazillion different lists of "tools you need to buy" when starting woodworking. It's pretty dizzying, but this site really did narrow it down to a somewhat manageable list: https://woodandshop.com/learn-traditional-woodworking-with-hand-tools/getting-started-traditional-handtool-woodworking-step-1/ &lt;-- I've written the list down elsewhere but I do think that this is a helpful place to start.</p>

            <title>Weeknote 2 - 21 to 27 Sept 2024</title>
            <pubDate>2024-09-27 08:28:44</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-2-21-to-27-sept-2024.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/weeknote-2-21-to-27-sept-2024.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>The week started "somewhat" normally. While our whole junior high team was out for last week's cross country race, our high school team raced pretty well (it was the "SCS II" Invitational). Lyla was still recovering, and many of the other junior highers were sick, so definitely a weird one.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the sickness saga in our own family hasn't quite completely finished. Last night, L came home from school and was running a fever again, and it seems to have held on through the night so she has a doctor's appointment today to rule out pneumonia or some other secondary infection post-flu.</p>

<p>We had a really, really tough day with P on Monday. Probably a total of 3-4 emotional explosions from her that neither Elaine or I dealt with particularly well. Some days we feel really stuck with her and like we haven't made any improvements at all. And then we feel a little crazy because things get better. Homework and responsibilities are clear triggers for her, so we are trying to continue to work through the <a href="https://livesinthebalance.org/">"Explosive Child" methodology</a>. It seems that when we stick with it, we see more and more success. When we sort of "fall off" that wagon is when we see regression.</p>

<p>I was able to start running this week again after being sick last week. Although, I think I overdid it a little bit by jumping back into lifting on Monday along with adding mileage starting Sunday. My legs were <em>thrashed</em> for a few days, though I was able to push through and got some 1200m intervals in Thursday.</p>

<p>Still reading: <em>Lore of Running</em> (this one is going to take forever, it's like 900+ pages). I finished <em>Piranesi</em> which was a great, fun, relatively quick read. I also started <em>Moonbound</em> by Robin Sloan this week.</p>

<p>We got a lot of rain at the beginning of the week, which has helped to bring somewhat "fall"-ish weather. That's been such a good respite from mid-to-upper 90s.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Plant in the fall garden (I added some more homemade Mel's Mix to the raised bed on Thursday)</li>
<li>Mortgage refi (unsure if I should continue to wait to see if rates drop more or not)</li>
<li>Deep clean the Honda</li>
<li>Buy a new dining table / chairs</li>
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I have the unfortunate personality trait of being interested in, well, <em>everything</em>. Things catch my attention really easy, and it's one of the great regrets of my life that I will not be able to pursue all my interests. One week I want to be a woodworker, the next I want to study health and exercise, the next I want to continue down the path of programming. </p>

<p>It also means that I struggle with <em>choosing</em> what interests to pursue in the first place. This is a classic Kierkegaardian problem -- not choosing <em>is</em> choosing, of course.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I found myself watching videos on building things this week. Mainly guitars and tiny homes.</p>

<h3>Daisy Tempest's guitar build series:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A44AQGv2wY0">Part 1</a></li>

</ul>

<p>I am seriously considering pre-ordering a <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/blog/introducing-the-light-phone-iii">Light Phone III</a>. It looks great, and seems like it would be a great tool for going further down the digital simplicity rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Alan Jacobs: <a href="https://blog.ayjay.org/pos-not-posse/">"POS, not POSSE"</a>, with a historic quote Louis C.K. quote from <a href="https://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/144251991476">Austin Kleon's old Tumblr</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have your number. It’s very dangerous to be liked by more people than should like you. It’s bad for them, and it’s bad for you. There’s gonna be a shock down the road for them, or you’re gonna dilute yourself and take yourself to a place where you can’t live with who you are. I think that you make an honest account of who you are and you live with the results. The results will be appropriate to who you are.</p>
