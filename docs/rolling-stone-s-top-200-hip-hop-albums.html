    <h1 class="post-title">Rolling Stone's Top 200 Hip Hop Albums</h1>
    <p>Rolling Stone released it's <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-hip-hop-albums-1323916">top 200 hip hop albums</a> 
of all time today. Naturally, it's controversial for the albums it includes, doesn't include, and its placement of some
albums above others. For me, I couldn't really care less about their placement. With lists like this, a single ranking
above or below another album is pretty subjective. But I'd be willing to say that, given a large group of hip-hop heads,
this list is probably pretty close to what a group like that might produced when asked for the best 200 albums.</p>

<p>Me? I'm excited about stuff like this. There is, of course, a ton of stuff in there that I have heard, but even more that
I haven't. Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerHuckabee/status/1526986060332511232">Tyler Huckabee's</a> 
listening to Rolling Stone's <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">top 500 albums</a> 
of all time (a perhaps even more difficult task, if there ever was one) in sequence from bottom to top, I think I'd like 
to do the same. Today I got through:</p>

<ul>
<li>Astroworld - Travis Scott: not my style. Favorite Song: "COFFEE BEAN"</li>
<li>Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance - Juice WRLD: also not my style. It doesn't feel "hip hop" to me, but again, it just wasn't for
for me. No favorite song.</li>
<li>Mr. Hood - KMD: Incredible. Great to hear Dumile before he becomes MF DOOM. Favorite song: hard to say. Maybe "Humrush"
or "Trial 'N' Error"</li>
</ul>

<p>I'll be working through the albums as much as I can, hoping to expand my experience and knowledge of hip hop. While I love
the genre, my experience is generally centered around my favorite 10-15 artists, and I don't listen to a lot of female
hip hop artists.</p>

<p>Here's a playlist of my favorites from the albums. Not necessarily a song from every one... I anticipate there will be
albums I don't really like all that much.</p>
