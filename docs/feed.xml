            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>In response to a <em>Wired</em> article about preserving our digital selves for an "afterlife," Alan Jacobs writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Notice also — this is universal in such discourse — the unexamined “we”: “2023 will be the year we broaden our definition of what it means to live forever.” Depends on who “we” are, I think. I for one am not interested in broadening my definition of what means to live forever in such a way that it isn’t living and doesn’t last forever.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Connected to this, I'm thinking about the recent spate of excitement around AI and large language models (specifically ChatGPT). Tyler Cowen wrote some about the winners and losers as AI becomes a functional part of how we interact with one another, especially online. One thing he mentions is the idea that perhaps the unreplicable will become more valuable in our society: athletics, gardening, etc.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Alternatively, many humans will run away from such competitive struggles altogether.  Currently the bots are much better at writing than say becoming a master gardener, which also requires skills of physical execution and moving in open space. We might thus see a great blossoming of talent in the area of gardening, and other hard to copy inputs, if only to protect one’s reputation and IP from the bots.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Athletes, in the broad sense of that term, may thus rise in status. Sculpture and dance might gain on writing in cultural import and creativity. Counterintuitively, if you wanted our culture to become more real and visceral in terms of what commands audience attention and inspiration, perhaps the bots are exactly what you’ve been looking for.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>The first thing I thought when I read Alan Jacobs's response to that article was this: perhaps the Cartesian "I think, therefore I am" is not so old-fashioned as 21st century philosophy has made it out to be. Cogito ergo sum could, in the day and age of AI and the preservation of our "digital selves," give us a way <em>out</em> of the frenetic online hive-mind thing we have going on right now. Cogito ergo sum allows me to reassert my individualism. I am more than a small bit of data that gets fed into a large language model so it can reproduce generic text about any given subject. I am more than a few terabytes of data at the end of my life so that "I" can be preserved for someone else to interact with.</p>

<p>(And I agree, who really wants to keep a lifelong record of everything we say digitally?? Have we not all watched those <em>Black Mirror</em> episodes?)</p>

<p>It seems to me that perhaps the early-to-late modern philosophers may still have something to say to us. Descartes can still teach us a thing or two about our humanity in the midst of AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <h3>Currently listening: <em>Midnight Marauders</em> - A Tribe Called Quest</h3>

<p>I gotta say, it's weird to listen to a group's discography, and for each album to be incredible, <em>and</em> for each album to be better than the last. Also fun to listen to these as I read the corresponding chapters in <em>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>.</p>

            <title>Filling up Time</title>
            <pubDate>12/15/2022 16:15:00</pubDate>
            <link>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/filling-up-time.html</link>
            <guid>https://cdbaca.github.io/ssg/filling-up-time.html</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>A couple of weeks ago, I was able to take the plunge on removing all of the "big name" social media. This has been a cool step for me, and mostly kind of a nothingburger if I'm being honest. I already wasn't really using Facebook, my Twitter use was minimal (because, of all of the platforms, Twitter is the one with the most potential for "addiction"), and Instagram was an on-again, off-again thing for me. Mostly I am a lurker on these platforms anyway.</p>

<p>In any case, my Facebook account is no more, and the same is true for Twitter. My Instagram account <em>technically</em> exists but only because I don't want someone using my standard handle (@cdbaca), and I kept up my final story about leaving IG "for good" (one can only hope).</p>

<p>The frustrating part of this experience for me is that I've noticed how easy it is to fill up time with other useless junk. Inasmuch as I am a Twitter junkie, I'm similarly a Reddit junkie. There's new content everyday! I can follow the subs I want to follow! There are new topics to discover all the time!</p>

<p>The problem with this, of course, is the potential for infinite (doom)scrolling, just like anywhere else. It's a mind-waste/time-fill, and I'm just using it more now that I can't scroll Instagram on my phone. That and once I get bored with Reddit, I'll do that weird mindless thing where I check all the websites I normally check: NPR, Gmail, Lifehacker/Gizmodo, etc., and then do the circle again.</p>

<p>That's frustrating. What am I filling up my time for? Is it just because my brain is looking for something to consume and trying to avoid boredom (I expect that's the case)? I want to find some balance here: I recognize I can't <em>simply</em> think and be serious all the time. Sometimes it's probably alright to go mindless for a few minutes. I just don't want it to be for two-ish hours a day -- that is, if my screentime to report from Apple is to be believed.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>All along, from the frothy 1990s to the percolating 2000s to the frozen 2010s to today, the web has been the sure thing. All along, it’s been growing and maturing, sprouting new capabilities. From my vantage point, that growth has seemed to accelerate in the past five years...</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>For people who care about creating worlds together, rather than getting rich, the web is the past and the web is the future. What luck, that this decentralized, permissionless system claimed a position at the heart of the internet, and stuck there. It’s limited, of course; frustrating; sometimes maddening. But that’s every creative medium. That’s life.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>--<a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/new-avenues/">"A Year of New Avenues"</a> - Robin Sloan</p>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Back in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes — but it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it provides the best place to talk about itself, I am telling you, some internal flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to happen.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I expressed frustration about this a couple of weeks ago (i.e., wanting to see more blogs that weren't <em>about blogs</em> but blogs about other things... homesteading or anthropology or design or whatever). But maybe Robin has a point here... the meta-ness of blogging about blogging is generative.</p>

<p>As a side note, this is sending me down another hole. Three things I've been rolling around in my head:</p>

<ol>
<li>I like e-ink, but damn do the companies that produce these products not make it easy to develop for their readers. Especially Kindle. I'm an avid Paperwhite user, but I have essentially <em>zero</em> ability to make anything for the Kindle. (I had an idea this morning for building an RSS service that automatically sends to Kindle... worth exploring).</li>
<li>This site is served on a VPS with a Digital Ocean droplet. But of course, that sent me down the rabbit hole of <a href="https://homebrewserver.club/">homebrewed servers</a>. So I'm thinking about getting a Raspberry Pi or something, hooking it up to a small portable hard drive and setting up my own little server at home. </li>
<li>Found this via RSS this morning: Ryan Cordell is a professor that teaches about digital humanities. <a href="https://ryancordell.org/teaching/">His teaching page is here</a>. Somewhere along the way, I guess he mentioned that he's moving all of his course stuff to Canvas (his school's LMS), but before that, he was building personal sites that contained his course material... which I LOVE. I get why you wouldn't do this (school policy, requiring students to use another platform, etc.), but the <em>feel</em> of independence and playfulness here is really fun. That's not even the point I'm trying to make though. I have also been thinking about what it means to teach digital literacy to middle and high schoolers. Everything from learning very basic coding, owning your own domain, how the web works, and how to identify and interact with good and bad information. Almost a "philosophy of the web" course/s informed by indie web stuff and Neil Postman.</li>
</ol>
