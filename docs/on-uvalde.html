    <h2>On Uvalde</h2>
    <p>I don't really have words for what happened in Uvalde, or in the hundreds of other schools, churches, and public
spaces when armed men have taken the lives of unsuspecting civilians. </p>

<p>My only words are this: on the whole, I think we are devoid of imagination as a society. We lack the ability to imagine
a better future for ourselves, a more just civilization for our children, an economy that does not favor the rich and 
poweful at the expense of the poor, a public and open space that needn't fear hateful and extremist violence at its
absolute, unbearable worst. We are a sick society, in need of more than simple reform. And it is difficult -- nearly 
impossible -- to not despair and wonder if we will ever have anything but the same, over and over again.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bruenig says it better than I could:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yesterday, before the families of Uvalde had buried their children, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a televised interview that he would “much rather have law-abiding citizens armed and trained so that they can respond when something like this happens, because it’s not going to be the last time.” That is to say: It’s going to go on indefinitely. It’s not an end, exactly, but life inside a permanent postscript to one’s own history. Here is America after there was no more hope.</p>
