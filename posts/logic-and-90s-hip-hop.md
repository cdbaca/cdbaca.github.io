I'm still working through Rolling Stone's top 200 hip hop albums (today is #189: _Crenshaw_ - Nipsey Hussle). Perhaps
this feeling will change, but I think this is probably going to reinforce my love of 90s hip hop. There is just something
about that era that the new stuff usually doesn't quite hit. Don't get me wrong, I feel the same as Logic here -- there's
nothing "wrong" with the new stuff. But listening to Pop Smoke or Juice WRLD feels like listening to a different _genre_ 
of music to me. And the truth is I don't find any kind of delight in that stuff the same way I love _Illmatic_ or _Black on
Both Sides_. Maybe I really am just an old-head like the guys around the office say.
