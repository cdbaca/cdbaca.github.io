Long ago, in my university career years, I had a running template "scratchpad" that I used to keep track of projects I was running, to-do lists, links I ran into, thoughts, etc. For some reason, when I left that job for the second time (lol) and began working at home, I abandoned that method even though I actually found it quite useful. I have been experimenting with the Arc browser for a while, and it's held some of my website links. I also like the "Spaces" feature, which helps to differentiate what I'm working on. But I have some concerns about Arc (namely, their stupid push for ["AI search"](https://cbaca.blog/further-down-the-road-towards-a-less-human-web.html). Also, Manu [posted some thoughts](https://manuelmoreale.com/some-more-thoughts-on-tbc) recently about Arc that made me rethink my use of their product... mostly that it's not "reimagining the internet," but just a fancy Chromium wrapper.)

In any case, what I *don't* want is for my links and things that I find to get sucked into a separate product that I won't have access to if I decide to stop using it or whatever. This actually happened with my former scratchpad notes because I was using Evernote and stopped last year. And I really hate that exporting notes from Evernote is such a hassle.

All that to say, I'm trying out a new scratchpad process using Apple Notes. Obviously that doesn't exactly solve the problem of them being "stuck" in an application, but Apple is a little friendlier to privacy and I'd anticipate I could transfer all those notes if I wanted to.

In theory, the best solution would be my own homegrown notes system built on .txt or .md files, but I'm not really at the point where I want to build that myself so... here we are.
