    <h2>What have I been doing?</h2>

<p>This is the second to last week of cross country. While I love cross country so much, I'm also ready to be done with early wake up calls and long Saturdays. Now onto the end of my race training!</p>

<p>In trying to decide on a woodworking bench design, I remembered that I had already bought the material a while back for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPiMjv7lkqI">Rex Krueger's low Roman-style bench</a>. While it's basic and will not meet all the needs I'll have for woodworking, it's:</p>

<p>a) a start, which is what I really need and,
b) "free" since the materials have already been bought</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this in spare little free moments I have -- 20 minutes here, 30 minutes there. I figure it's the only real way I'll be able to actually pursue a hobby that's a craft and not just wasting my time. Once the bench is built I'm hoping to learn to cut some more precise joints, and maybe make a few of the projects from <a href="https://www.freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/">Matt Estlea's free woodworking school</a>.</p>

<p>I took Wednesday off and we all went to the Texas State Fair. Besides the heat, it turns out Wednesdays are a great time to go. The crowds were very low, and we had such a great time. We all ate some good fair food (the strawberry pop-tart beignetffle was a winner). Paisley won a fair game and got a giant stuffed boba tea. We saw a horse show, a magic show (meh), and did the petting zoo. The fair isn't really my jam, but the low crowds meant I didn't find it too overwhelming.</p>

<p>Elaine entered a photo competition a few weeks ago and was selected as a top-ten finalist, so we went to the event for that last night. Not a winner, but it was still exciting to be in the top ten. We ate dinner with Shelby at Red Robin after, and it was great to catch up after a long time and after all the sickness over the last couple months that we've been dealing with.</p>

<h2>What do I need to take care of?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish up refinancing on the house. We should be able to save almost $300 on P&amp;I on our home, going from 7.625% to 6.125%. (Unfortunately, our taxes were also GROSSLY miscalculated, so my guess is our monthly payment will roughly stay the same AND we'll have a pretty big tax bill that we'll need to catch up on. Bummer.)</li>
<li>Find a decent budget software and actual start working on it / sticking to it with Elaine.</li>
<li>Clean out the shower (it's due for it's monthly grout cleaning)</li>
- 
</ul>

<h2>What caught my interest?</h2>

<p>I found a YouTube Channel that has some episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnUH-yJPVuw">Britain's Best Woodworker, season 2</a>, which is fun. Sort of like that British baking show, but for woodworking.</p>

<p>When I was watching some guitar maintenance and building videos last week, I came across an old school HTML-style site that seems to have some really great info on guitar care and maintenance (diy): http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/OwnerManual/manssguitar.html</p>

<p>There are a bazillion different lists of "tools you need to buy" when starting woodworking. It's pretty dizzying, but this site really did narrow it down to a somewhat manageable list: https://woodandshop.com/learn-traditional-woodworking-with-hand-tools/getting-started-traditional-handtool-woodworking-step-1/ &lt;-- I've written the list down elsewhere but I do think that this is a helpful place to start.</p>
