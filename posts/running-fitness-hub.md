There's a _zillion_ different ways of thinking about fitness... according to the internet, anyway. Most are, to put it mildly, garbage. There's too much just straight up garbage out there, but for the average person, it's hard to know how to even start building a framework for what is good information and what isn't.

Take some common ideas about running: it's good to static stretch before a run, running isn't doing anything unless you're huffing and puffing, strength work is bad for runners (or if you do it, you definitely _shouldn't_ lift heavy, God forbid), etc.

I guess, on some level, some of those ideas seem intuitive. Stretching can kinda sorta feel good before or after a run. Some powerlifters look huge and it seems like maybe you shouldn't carry around a lot of bulk as a runner. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But so much of the studies that have been done over the past decade or two when it comes to running are indicating the exact opposite of the above statements is true. [There's no clear benefit to static stretching before or after a run.](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-stretching-doesn-t-prevent-injuries-flna1c9445108), most of your runs should be slow (see the 80/20 rule), and runners show much higher benefits (injury prevention and increased strength) from _low rep, high weight_ strength training. 

Why then, do these myths continue? Maybe because if I search for something like "static stretching running", the top two results are "What are the Best Static Stretches for Runners?" where the author (?? or AI blog post writer, probably) writes:

> While regular assisted stretching sessions are highly recommended for runners, static stretching is also great when you’re cooling down. In case you’re not aware, your muscles tend to tighten up while you’re working out or running.

What? Who says?

The next result is "Great Stretches for Running" from _REI_ for goodness' sake! You'd think a place like REI would have the resources to vet their athletic and exercise information before it gets posted to their website. They come across as at least somewhat of an authority in outdoor activity. Now, to be fair, they mentionn that static stretching should be saved for after a run... but again, who says? What evidence do we have that static stretching is helpful for runners? The more authoritative websites I've read indicate that it's mobility, foam rolling/massage, and strength that positively affect running performance.

This gets to another issue I am starting to have with the internet, based on this post from Sandy Maguire: ["Why Is the Web So Monotonous? Google.](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/monotonous-web/index.html) That's another post for another day, but Google has made the internet boring and also results in a web full of trash information. It can feel a little like the entire internet has taken Steve Bannon's political strategy to heart -- i.e., ["flooding the zone with sh*t."](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation)

Anyway, like I said, another post for another day. On this page, I'd like to gather up the information I've come across that seems to have some merit when it comes to fitness, wellness, and running. I'm sure some of it still won't be the best information, or other information will come to light that will debunk what I post here. But it's at least a start with the places I've found that seem like they have both uncomplicated and reliable information.

## General Fitness
- [r/Fitness Wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/), especially the section on Beginner Fitness and Barbell Strength Training
- [r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)

## Running
- [Heather Hart responding to Matt Frazer of No Meat Athlete](https://www.nomeatathlete.com/crossfit-endurance-training/#:~:text=3.%20OK%20so,anyone%20is%20interested!)) On training for ultras without running much during training. The highlighted section that is linked I found particularly interesting, as she responds to his use of the common notion that running is "bad" for joint health in the long term.
- In relation to the above: [Running and Osteoarthritis: Does Recreational or Competitive Running Increase the Risk?](https://www.jospt.org/doi/full/10.2519/jospt.2017.0505). Hint: recreational running seems to be _beneficial_ to long term join health.
- [Science of Ultra](https://www.scienceofultra.com/). Shawn Bearden is a professor of physiology and has a Ph.D in Exercise Physiology, and has run a lab since 2004. Podcast & blog, with a focus on evidence-based strategies for training.
